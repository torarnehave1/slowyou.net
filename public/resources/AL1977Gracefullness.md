"Discover the secrets to vibrant health and a radiant presence!

According to Alexander Lowen, author of "The Way to Vibrant Health: A Manual of Bioenergetic Exercises," a person's manner, sparkle in their eyes, tone of voice, and overall aliveness and vibrancy express who they are more than words or actions. These qualities are not something one can deliberately cultivate, but rather manifestations of emotional and physical health.

Join the #SlowYou movement and explore the #AlivenessLab to learn how to cultivate a healthy body and mind. Take time for yourself each day, practice gratitude, and surround yourself with positive people to boost your emotional wellness.
