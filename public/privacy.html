    <p>SlowYou.io ("SlowYou", "we", "us", or "our") provides an educational platform to help students learn at their own pace (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy applies to students' and teachers' information we receive in the course of providing the Service.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Student Data:</strong> With schools' and/or parents' consent, we collect student information needed to provide the Service, including student ID, name, grade level, and any data entered directly into the Service. We are considered a "school official" under FERPA and receive this data pursuant to agreements with schools.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher Data:</strong> We collect teachers' names and email addresses to create their accounts on the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect certain information automatically when the Service is used, such as IP address, browser type, and information about how users engage with the Service. We use this in aggregate form only to assess and improve the Service.</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
<p>We use the student and teacher data collected solely to provide the Service to schools. We do not use student data for marketing, advertising or other commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We share information with trusted service providers who assist us in operating and securing the Service. We may also share information with professional advisors and to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We do not sell student data or disclose it for marketing purposes. Aggregated, de-identified usage data may be used in reports to schools about students' experiences with the Service.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable security measures to protect the data collected, including limiting employee access, encrypting data in transit, and performing periodic security audits. However, no security measures are perfect.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is intended for use by children under 13 with their school's consent and supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 outside the school context. Parents can contact us to request deletion of any student data collected in error.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify users of any material changes. We recommend reviewing this Policy periodically.</p>
