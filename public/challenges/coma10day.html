        <p class="lead">A Journey to Deep Relaxation and Restful Sleep and Protection for High Stressors.</p>
        <p>
            Brown noise is a type of noise that has a lower frequency and a rougher sound compared to white noise. It is believed to have a calming effect on the body and brain, and some people use it to help them sleep or relax. The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the brain that produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Delta and theta waves are types of brain waves that are associated with deep sleep and relaxation. It is suggested that listening to brown noise can help to increase the production of delta and theta waves, which can lead to a deeper, more restful sleep.

        <h2>Coma: A Sound Journey</h2>
        <p>
            This sound journey, “Coma,” is not just a simple lullaby, it’s a powerful deep healing tool. Listening to “Coma” on a regular basis can help you to release stress and tension, reducing anxiety and depression symptoms. It can also help to improve your overall emotional well-being and make you feel more balanced and centered. So, make sure to take the time to relax after listening to “Coma,” and allow your body and mind to fully absorb the benefits of this powerful sound journey.

        <h2>Coma: A Sound Recording</h2>
        <p>
            “Coma” is not just any ordinary sound recording; it was captured on board a boat in Istanbul on the Bosphorus during a full moon. The recording captures not only the soothing sounds of brown noise from the boat’s engine, but also the natural soundscapes of the water, the current of the sea, and the atmosphere of the boat. The full moon on the Bosphorus also adds to the emotional and mystical atmosphere.
