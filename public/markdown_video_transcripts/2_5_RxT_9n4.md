**[00:00:46]** Krishnamurti:
I believe this is the last talk.

**[00:00:49]** On Wednesday we will have
some dialogues for five days.

**[00:00:58]** Why are you all
sitting so quietly?

**[00:01:12]** I wonder if you have ever noticed,

**[00:01:17]** our minds are very rarely
very quiet,

**[00:01:26]** silent, having no problems,

**[00:01:33]** or having problems,
putting them aside for a while,

**[00:01:39]** and having a free mind,

**[00:01:43]** a mind that is not cluttered,

**[00:01:48]** a mind that is not stretching out,

**[00:01:53]** not seeking anything;

**[00:01:57]** but absolutely quiet, silent,

**[00:02:03]** and perhaps observing

**[00:02:08]** not only what is happening
in the world,

**[00:02:16]** but also what is happening
in the inner world,

**[00:02:21]** in the world of one’s own existence,

**[00:02:28]** one’s own attitudes, travails
– just to observe.

**[00:02:39]** I wonder if one has ever
done this kind of thing.

**[00:02:43]** Or, are we always
seeking, searching,

**[00:02:49]** asking, analysing, demanding,

**[00:02:53]** trying to fulfil,
trying to follow somebody,

**[00:02:59]** some ideal, and so on,

**[00:03:04]** or trying to establish
a good relationship with another?

**[00:03:17]** I wonder why there is this constant
struggle and strife and seeking.

**[00:03:33]** One goes to India
– I don’t know why –

**[00:03:39]** seeking something extraordinary
that is going to happen

**[00:03:43]** when you go to that country,

**[00:03:46]** follow somebody
who tells you to dance, to sing,

**[00:03:52]** to do whatever you want.

**[00:03:56]** And there are those
who try to force you

**[00:03:59]** to meditate in a certain fashion,

**[00:04:03]** accept authority,
do certain rituals,

**[00:04:11]** shout when you like,
and so on.

**[00:04:16]** Why are we all doing this?

**[00:04:26]** What is our everlasting thirst?

**[00:04:34]** What is it that we are seeking?

**[00:04:39]** If we could go into that
a little bit,

**[00:04:43]** try to find out for ourselves

**[00:04:47]** what it is that we are longing,
searching, seeking,

**[00:04:54]** trying to fulfil,
trying to become something.

**[00:05:01]** Apart from the religious beliefs
and dogmas and rituals

**[00:05:08]** which fairly intelligent people
have put all those aside,

**[00:05:15]** and not going to Tibet or to Japan,
or trying to do Zen Buddhism

**[00:05:22]** – you know,
the whole business of it –

**[00:05:25]** but remaining quietly
at one’s own home,

**[00:05:33]** or taking a solitary walk,

**[00:05:38]** can one ask

**[00:05:40]** why there is
this everlasting thirst?

**[00:05:50]** Could we go into that a little?

**[00:05:56]** Because we have talked about most
things during the last six talks.

**[00:06:05]** We have talked about fear,
thinking together;

**[00:06:13]** we have talked about sorrow,

**[00:06:20]** pleasure;

**[00:06:24]** and we also talked
about intelligence

**[00:06:27]** and love and compassion.

**[00:06:31]** As we pointed out,

**[00:06:35]** without intelligence,
which we carefully went into,

**[00:06:43]** there cannot be love, or compassion.

**[00:06:48]** They go together.

**[00:06:51]** Not the intelligence of books
and cunning contrivance of thought,

**[00:07:00]** nor the intelligence
of a very clever, subtle mind,

**[00:07:11]** but the intelligence
that perceives directly

**[00:07:18]** what is not true
and what is false,

**[00:07:24]** what is dangerous,

**[00:07:26]** and immediately lets it go,

**[00:07:30]** such a quality of mind
is intelligent.

**[00:07:38]** And if we could go into that
this morning,

**[00:07:42]** not only into what is it
that we are all seeking, longing.

**[00:07:51]** And perhaps as we go along,

**[00:07:56]** find out for ourselves
what is the quality of a mind

**[00:08:02]** mind being all our senses,

**[00:08:07]** all our reactions,

**[00:08:12]** all our emotions

**[00:08:19]** and the capacity
to think very clearly

**[00:08:23]** – all that is the mind,

**[00:08:28]** the essence of which is thought.

**[00:08:33]** And perhaps we could
talk over together

**[00:08:39]** what is the nature of meditation,

**[00:08:43]** and if there is anything in life,
in our daily existence,

**[00:08:53]** not only material activities
and material possessions

**[00:08:59]** – money, sex, sensations –

**[00:09:02]** but also beyond all that,

**[00:09:04]** if there is something
really sacred,

**[00:09:08]** not put together by thought,

**[00:09:15]** not the images that thought
has created in various forms,

**[00:09:20]** in various cathedrals,
temples, and so on,

**[00:09:25]** but actually, for ourselves,
find out,

**[00:09:34]** perhaps through meditation,

**[00:09:38]** being free of all illusion and
deceit and thinking very honestly,

**[00:09:45]** if there is something
that is really sacred,

**[00:09:51]** which is the movement of meditation.

**[00:09:58]** So first, let us enquire,
if we may,

**[00:10:04]** think together,

**[00:10:06]** what is it that
we are hungering after?

**[00:10:18]** Most people have had various types
and varieties of experiences,

**[00:10:29]** not only sensual experiences,

**[00:10:33]** but incidents
that have brought about

**[00:10:42]** various emotional, sensational
and romantic movements,

**[00:10:52]** but also these experiences
that one has had

**[00:10:58]** are rather trivial,

**[00:11:01]** and perhaps all experiences
are rather trivial.

**[00:11:13]** And when we begin to enquire

**[00:11:18]** what it is that we are all
seeking, wanting, longing,

**[00:11:25]** is it a superficial, mere sensory

**[00:11:34]** or something which desire seeks,

**[00:11:40]** which must obviously
be rather superficial?

**[00:11:46]** And can we,
in thinking over together,

**[00:11:52]** move from the superficiality

**[00:11:57]** to a more deeper, wider enquiry?

**[00:12:11]** Right?

**[00:12:14]** That is, we are,
you and the speaker,

**[00:12:18]** are thinking out together

**[00:12:25]** if all our longings are merely
superficial, sensory demands,

**[00:12:41]** or is the longing,
the searching, the thirst

**[00:12:46]** for something
far beyond all that?

**[00:12:50]** You understand my question?

**[00:13:12]** How do you enquire into this?

**[00:13:19]** When you have put this question,

**[00:13:23]** whether your enquiry, your longing
is merely superficial,

**[00:13:29]** such as wanting more money,
better relationship,

**[00:13:35]** trying to fulfil,
trying to become happy

**[00:13:39]** – you know, superficially,
on the surface –

**[00:13:44]** how do you enquire into that?

**[00:13:49]** Through analysis?

**[00:13:54]** Analysis is still
the same movement of thought

**[00:14:01]** – looking back.

**[00:14:05]** And analytically,
thought examining itself

**[00:14:12]** with its accidents
its experiences, its examination,

**[00:14:16]** will still be limited

**[00:14:18]** because thought is limited.
That is clear.

**[00:14:23]** But that is the only instrument
we have,

**[00:14:29]** and so we keep on repeating,

**[00:14:34]** using the same instrument,
knowing that it is limited

**[00:14:39]** and knowing that it cannot
solve the problem,

**[00:14:42]** or have the capacity
to enquire very deeply,

**[00:14:48]** and yet we keep on doing this.

**[00:14:51]** Right?

**[00:14:54]** We never realise, I think,

**[00:14:57]** that this instrument, however blunt,
however used up,

**[00:15:06]** cannot solve the problem

**[00:15:08]** and therefore put it aside.

**[00:15:10]** We don’t seem to be capable
of doing that – why?

**[00:15:17]** Please, enquire with me.

**[00:15:20]** You understand my question?

**[00:15:28]** Thought has created
the technological world.

**[00:15:34]** Right?

**[00:15:35]** Thought has created
all the divisions in the world.

**[00:15:40]** Thought has created
not only national divisions,

**[00:15:45]** but religious divisions,
ideological divisions,

**[00:15:50]** every form of division
between two people;

**[00:15:57]** however much they may think
they love each other,

**[00:16:01]** there is still this division,

**[00:16:06]** and thought is responsible for that,
which is obvious.

**[00:16:12]** Would we accept that?

**[00:16:16]** That thought in its activity
will inevitably

**[00:16:21]** – being limited,
being the result of the past –

**[00:16:28]** must inevitably bring about
a division and therefore limited.

**[00:16:36]** Thought can never see the whole.

**[00:16:39]** Right?

**[00:16:42]** Now can we ask:

**[00:16:47]** is such activity superficial,

**[00:16:50]** or can thought with its limitation
enquire more deeply?

**[00:16:58]** You follow what I am saying?

**[00:17:01]** We have understood each other?
Can we go on?

**[00:17:06]** Please,
it is not verbal explanation,

**[00:17:10]** it is not that
verbally we are clear,

**[00:17:14]** but rather together
find out for ourselves

**[00:17:26]** what is the root of this hunger,

**[00:17:33]** great desire to search, to find

**[00:17:41]** – you know, this constant movement,
out and in.

**[00:17:48]** This is obvious, right?

**[00:17:59]** Is observation
– to observe –

**[00:18:08]** the instrument of thought?

**[00:18:11]** You follow?

**[00:18:12]** Please, go into this
a little bit with me.

**[00:18:16]** To observe:

**[00:18:22]** does that involve
the movement of thought?

**[00:18:28]** You may observe,

**[00:18:32]** then conclude,

**[00:18:36]** conceive,

**[00:18:39]** create through that observation.

**[00:18:42]** The creation, the activity
through that observation

**[00:18:47]** is the movement of thought.

**[00:18:49]** That is what we generally do.

**[00:18:52]** I see that colour,
one sees that colour,

**[00:18:56]** there is the observation of it,

**[00:18:59]** then like and dislike, prejudices

**[00:19:03]** – all those are
the movement of thought.

**[00:19:07]** Right?

**[00:19:10]** Can one observe

**[00:19:13]** without any of the movement
of thought?

**[00:19:25]** Does that require
a kind of discipline?

**[00:19:30]** You understand?

**[00:19:35]** Discipline, the root of it,
is to learn.

**[00:19:41]** To learn, not to conform,
not to imitate,

**[00:19:47]** not to make the mind dull, routine
– all that –

**[00:19:51]** but to learn.

**[00:19:54]** Now can one learn
that the activity of observation

**[00:20:05]** without the thought creating
the image out of that observation

**[00:20:11]** and acting according to that image.

**[00:20:15]** Right?
Can one merely observe?

**[00:20:20]** Which is to learn, to observe
and to learn or to be aware

**[00:20:28]** of the movement of thought
interfering with that observation?

**[00:20:33]** To learn about it.

**[00:20:37]** Which is actual discipline
– to learn.

**[00:20:45]** I wonder if you have got this.

**[00:20:48]** Are we following each other?

**[00:20:50]** Are we doing it as we are talking,
or you are going to think it over?

**[00:20:57]** Please, we are all doing it
together,

**[00:21:00]** thinking it out together.

**[00:21:04]** So we are saying:

**[00:21:09]** when there is observation

**[00:21:15]** into, say, our longing,
our thirst for something,

**[00:21:20]** can you observe without any motive

**[00:21:26]** – motive being the past,

**[00:21:29]** which may be the desire,
the conclusion of thought –

**[00:21:35]** without the past interfering
with the actual observation?

**[00:21:43]** Can you do that?

**[00:21:47]** That is to learn.

**[00:21:50]** This whole movement:
the observation,

**[00:21:55]** the interference of thought

**[00:21:59]** what the result and the effect
of all this movement is,

**[00:22:03]** just to observe.

**[00:22:10]** One wants to learn.

**[00:22:17]** Learning is the accumulation
of knowledge, generally.

**[00:22:23]** Right?

**[00:22:25]** School, college, university

**[00:22:28]** or learning about relationship,
and so on, learning.

**[00:22:41]** Having accumulated knowledge,
then act.

**[00:22:46]** Right?

**[00:22:48]** The purpose of learning is
to accumulate knowledge

**[00:22:53]** and from that act skilfully,
or unskilfully – it depends.

**[00:23:01]** Or you act and then learn,

**[00:23:08]** which is from action
accumulate knowledge.

**[00:23:12]** You have understood?

**[00:23:14]** You are following all this?

**[00:23:16]** So our action is always based
on the accumulation of knowledge.

**[00:23:24]** Right?

**[00:23:25]** Acting and learning from acting,
and accumulating.

**[00:23:30]** Accumulating knowledge
and acting.

**[00:23:36]** Right?

**[00:23:38]** So our actions are always
based upon the past,

**[00:23:44]** or the past projecting the future,
and acting according to the future.

**[00:23:51]** It is the same movement, modified,
but it is still the same movement.

**[00:23:58]** Right?

**[00:23:59]** I wonder
if you are following all this.

**[00:24:02]** You are doing it, sirs?

**[00:24:26]** Hot!

**[00:24:37]** We are pointing out
something entirely different.

**[00:24:42]** You understand?

**[00:24:44]** Accumulating knowledge
and then acting.

**[00:24:49]** Accumulating knowledge

**[00:24:50]** and projecting
from that knowledge the future

**[00:24:54]** and acting from the future.

**[00:24:58]** So our actions are invariably

**[00:25:04]** the result of the past
or the future,

**[00:25:07]** that is, action based on time
– yesterday, today and tomorrow.

**[00:25:15]** Yesterday meeting the present
which is today,

**[00:25:19]** modifying itself and proceeding.

**[00:25:22]** Right?

**[00:25:23]** Our action is based on that.

**[00:25:26]** So our actions are always
incomplete, obviously.

**[00:25:33]** Because in that
there are regrets,

**[00:25:37]** a sense of frustration;

**[00:25:41]** they are never complete,
– obviously.

**[00:25:44]** Right?

**[00:25:46]** Now we are pointing out
something else,

**[00:25:49]** totally different thing,

**[00:25:51]** which is, an observation

**[00:25:54]** in which the past
and the future doesn’t exist.

**[00:26:00]** Just to observe.

**[00:26:05]** As one observes
if he is a good scientist

**[00:26:08]** through a microscope observing
what is actually going on.

**[00:26:15]** Right?

**[00:26:18]** When he observes
what is actually going on,

**[00:26:25]** the thing which he is observing
undergoes a change,

**[00:26:29]** undergoes a movement.

**[00:26:31]** Right?
Please, listen to this!

**[00:26:39]** Can one observe the longing,

**[00:26:45]** the seeking, the urge,

**[00:26:48]** the intense energy
that is demanding,

**[00:26:52]** just to observe that
without the movement of the past?

**[00:26:59]** You have got it?

**[00:27:02]** Are you following all this?

**[00:27:05]** It is not terribly intellectual,
please.

**[00:27:09]** It is merely logical,
merely reasonable,

**[00:27:16]** and therefore rather sane.

**[00:27:19]** Sane, which means healthy.

**[00:27:28]** So can one do that?

**[00:27:31]** To observe our longing,

**[00:27:39]** what it is we want
out of life,

**[00:27:49]** what it is we are
seeking, hunting

**[00:27:57]** – most of us are,
otherwise you all wouldn’t be here.

**[00:28:10]** That is
– please, go into it a little more –

**[00:28:15]** you read books –
philosophy, psychology,

**[00:28:21]** doctorate in this and that,

**[00:28:23]** or so-called religious books.

**[00:28:30]** In those they are
always pointing out

**[00:28:33]** that there is something beyond

**[00:28:36]** – parapsychology,
you understand? –

**[00:28:38]** more, something more and more,
deeper and deeper and deeper.

**[00:28:45]** And having read those one says,

**[00:28:48]** ‘Perhaps there is,
I am going after that’.

**[00:28:53]** And then one gets caught

**[00:29:01]** by the priests, by the gurus,

**[00:29:05]** by the latest fashion,
and so on,

**[00:29:13]** till you think
you have found something

**[00:29:17]** which is satisfying – right? –
which gives you...

**[00:29:21]** You say, ‘I am perfectly happy,
I don’t have to seek any more’.

**[00:29:29]** Which may perhaps
be an illusion.

**[00:29:32]** And most people like
to live in illusions.

**[00:29:44]** And all your search
and your demands, your hunger

**[00:29:48]** has not solved
or brought about a good society

**[00:29:55]** – you understand? –
a good society,

**[00:29:59]** a society that is based on peace,

**[00:30:04]** there is no violence,

**[00:30:09]** there is no each one trying
to fulfil his own ambitions,

**[00:30:14]** all the rest of the violence.

**[00:30:18]** The purpose of our enquiry
into all this

**[00:30:23]** is to bring about a good society

**[00:30:27]** in which we human beings
can live happily without fear,

**[00:30:36]** without conflict,

**[00:30:39]** without all this
striving, struggling,

**[00:30:44]** all the brutality
and all the rest of it,

**[00:30:50]** because that’s
the intention of enquiry,

**[00:30:56]** because a society is built
out of the relationship of people.

**[00:31:04]** If our relationship is not
correct, precise, actual,

**[00:31:12]** then we create a society
which is what it is now,

**[00:31:16]** which is what is happening
in the world.

**[00:31:20]** Right?

**[00:31:23]** So our enquiry into this:

**[00:31:30]** which is,
why human beings separately –

**[00:31:34]** you are seeking something,

**[00:31:36]** another is seeking
something totally different,

**[00:31:40]** each one is asking
something different.

**[00:31:46]** Right?

**[00:31:48]** And therefore there is always
this self-centred movement.

**[00:31:58]** And the society
which we have created

**[00:32:01]** is based on these
self-centred problems,

**[00:32:07]** self-centred ambitions,

**[00:32:11]** fulfilment
and self-centred discipline

**[00:32:15]** which says, ‘I must’,

**[00:32:20]** which brings about violence.

**[00:32:24]** We are enquiring into all that,
which we have,

**[00:32:29]** and also we are enquiring
into a mind,

**[00:32:34]** your mind – mind –
you understand?

**[00:32:37]** When we use the word ‘mind’,

**[00:32:38]** it is not your mind or my mind
– mind.

**[00:32:44]** Because your mind is like the mind
of thousands and millions of people.

**[00:32:51]** Right?

**[00:32:53]** Striving, struggling, demanding,
following, accepting,

**[00:32:59]** obeying, idealising,
belonging to some religion,

**[00:33:05]** sorrow, pain, anxiety

**[00:33:11]** – your mind is that,
and the other minds are like that.

**[00:33:15]** Right?

**[00:33:17]** So your mind is not yours.

**[00:33:21]** It is the mind.

**[00:33:24]** I don’t know if you see this.

**[00:33:26]** You may not see this
because your vanity,

**[00:33:29]** your sense of individual importance

**[00:33:32]** may prevent this observation,
which is actual.

**[00:33:38]** Right?
I wonder if you see this.

**[00:33:46]** That is why,
until we really understand this

**[00:33:51]** that we human beings are
so similar psychologically,

**[00:34:02]** we human beings right throughout
the world are so unhappy.

**[00:34:09]** They all pray, but prayer
doesn’t answer this problem.

**[00:34:15]** They are still unhappy,
still striving, still despairing.

**[00:34:21]** This is the common mind.

**[00:34:28]** And so when we are enquiring,

**[00:34:30]** we are enquiring
into the human being,

**[00:34:36]** not me and you.

**[00:34:39]** We are human beings.

**[00:34:43]** I wonder if you see all this.

**[00:34:48]** And in enquiring into that,

**[00:34:53]** can one observe the outward world,

**[00:35:00]** the divisions
and all the rest of it,

**[00:35:02]** the terror,
the danger,

**[00:35:06]** the politicians
with their criminalities

**[00:35:20]** – can we observe all that,

**[00:35:26]** just to observe,
not draw a conclusion?

**[00:35:32]** If we observe
what is happening out there,

**[00:35:38]** and equally observe
what is happening inwardly,

**[00:35:45]** then our actions are not
your action and my action.

**[00:35:51]** I don’t know if you follow all this.

**[00:35:56]** Because we are then acting together

**[00:36:03]** – do you understand?

**[00:36:04]** because we have observed
the same thing together.

**[00:36:13]** Now we are asking
what it is that we are seeking?

**[00:36:20]** You understand?

**[00:36:23]** If you ask yourself
what is it you are seeking,

**[00:36:27]** is it money,

**[00:36:30]** is it security,

**[00:36:35]** is it to be free from fear,

**[00:36:39]** so that you can have
everlasting pleasure,

**[00:36:47]** is it that you are seeking to be
free from the burden of sorrow?

**[00:36:54]** Not only your burden,
but the world’s burden of sorrow.

**[00:37:03]** Or are you seeking

**[00:37:08]** – apart from all
the religious nonsense –

**[00:37:12]** or are you seeking something
which is timeless,

**[00:37:25]** something that thought
has not touched at all?

**[00:37:30]** You understand?

**[00:37:33]** Something essentially original,

**[00:37:45]** something that is
absolutely incorruptible?

**[00:37:54]** So find out for yourself
as a human being,

**[00:38:01]** like the rest of the other
human beings in the world,

**[00:38:05]** what is it one is longing,
seeking, hungering after.

**[00:38:21]** If one is wanting experience

**[00:38:31]** because one has had
sensory experiences,

**[00:38:36]** sexual experiences,
the experiences of various kinds,

**[00:38:41]** and one has said,
‘That is enough,

**[00:38:43]** I have had all those,
but I want some other kind’

**[00:38:47]** – you follow?
Some more.

**[00:38:51]** Is that what you are seeking?

**[00:38:56]** Some experience

**[00:39:01]** which will give you great delight,

**[00:39:05]** great understanding,

**[00:39:12]** an illumination,

**[00:39:19]** a transformation.

**[00:39:27]** How will you find out?

**[00:39:35]** First of all, to find out,
one must be free of all illusion.

**[00:39:42]** Right?

**[00:39:47]** Which means terrible honesty,

**[00:39:54]** so that your mind
doesn’t deceive itself.

**[00:39:59]** Right?

**[00:40:08]** Not to deceive itself,

**[00:40:17]** one must understand
the whole nature of desire.

**[00:40:21]** Right?

**[00:40:23]** Because it is desire
that creates illusion:

**[00:40:27]** through desire one wants fulfilment,

**[00:40:33]** one hopes for something more.

**[00:40:36]** So unless you comprehend the whole
nature and the structure of desire,

**[00:40:42]** it will inevitably create illusion.

**[00:40:49]** And we went
into the question of desire.

**[00:40:56]** So can your mind,

**[00:40:58]** having understood
the activity of desire,

**[00:41:04]** know its relative value

**[00:41:07]** and therefore be free to observe?

**[00:41:11]** Which means you observe
without any kind of illusion.

**[00:41:22]** Nationalism is an illusion.

**[00:41:25]** Right? Obviously.
That is very easy.

**[00:41:38]** The illusions that thought
has created

**[00:41:44]** – right? –

**[00:41:45]** is one aware
of the illusions?

**[00:41:52]** Oh, come on, sirs.

**[00:41:59]** And when the mind is
free of illusions,

**[00:42:04]** and so being absolutely
without any hypocrisy,

**[00:42:12]** being clear, honest,

**[00:42:20]** then we can begin to enquire:

**[00:42:24]** enquire into something,

**[00:42:29]** asking whether there is
a timeless existence

**[00:42:36]** – you understand? –

**[00:42:40]** a timeless truth.

**[00:42:47]** That is, this is where
meditation comes into being.

**[00:42:53]** Right?
You are following all this?

**[00:42:59]** Have any of you done meditation?

**[00:43:03]** Probably not,
or probably have:

**[00:43:06]** transcendental meditation,
Tibetan meditation,

**[00:43:10]** the Hindu meditation, the Buddhist
meditation, the Zen meditation.

**[00:43:16]** Probably you have played with
all those – seriously or flippantly.

**[00:43:30]** All those,
as far as one can understand,

**[00:43:34]** and the speaker has discussed
this question with all the scholars,

**[00:43:39]** of all the various circuses,

**[00:43:45]** and their whole concept is:

**[00:43:53]** that thought must be controlled,

**[00:44:03]** that one must have discipline,

**[00:44:07]** one must subjugate one’s own feeling
to something other than ‘what is’,

**[00:44:17]** through awareness,
through control,

**[00:44:23]** through constant alertness

**[00:44:30]** – you know all this, don’t you?

**[00:44:31]** And repeat certain mantras, slogans:

**[00:44:41]** you can repeat ‘amen’ or ‘Coca-Cola’
or what you like

**[00:44:45]** – no, don’t laugh,
they are all similar.

**[00:44:51]** So what we are saying is:

**[00:44:54]** meditation has been
accepted to be all this.

**[00:45:04]** Now if you want to find out
what is meditation,

**[00:45:08]** not just accept
what somebody says,

**[00:45:12]** if you want to find out,

**[00:45:22]** certain obvious things
are necessary.

**[00:45:27]** There must be no authority,

**[00:45:37]** because then you depend on that.

**[00:45:42]** Right?
Obviously.

**[00:45:44]** Therefore you are struggling,
you are imitating, conforming.

**[00:45:57]** And one must understand
the nature of control.

**[00:46:04]** Who is the controller?
You understand?

**[00:46:09]** You understand this?

**[00:46:11]** I wonder
if you understand all this.

**[00:46:13]** No?

**[00:46:18]** Are you interested in all this?

**[00:46:23]** Because it is your life,
not my life.

**[00:46:28]** This is your everyday life
we are talking about

**[00:46:37]** – what is involved in it,

**[00:46:41]** whether one can be free of all this
chaos, confusion and misery.

**[00:46:50]** And this is the enquiry,

**[00:46:55]** you are enquiring,
not me enquiring and you accepting;

**[00:46:59]** we are together enquiring,
we are together taking the journey.

**[00:47:09]** So first, as we said,
no authority,

**[00:47:15]** which means
cease to be second-hand.

**[00:47:24]** You understand?

**[00:47:27]** We are all second-hand people,

**[00:47:34]** because second-hand being tradition.

**[00:47:39]** We never say,
‘Look, I have put away all that,

**[00:47:42]** let me look’.

**[00:47:48]** The next question is control:

**[00:47:54]** from childhood we are trained,
educated to control, to suppress,

**[00:48:00]** or the other extreme
which is what is happening now

**[00:48:04]** – do what you like, do your thing!

**[00:48:11]** Which is the opposite
of the other.

**[00:48:17]** So one must understand
the whole movement of control.

**[00:48:27]** Is there a way of living
– please, listen to this –

**[00:48:31]** is there a way of living
without any form of control?

**[00:48:40]** Which doesn’t mean
doing what you like,

**[00:48:45]** either permissiveness
or the other – indulgence.

**[00:48:52]** Is there a way of living

**[00:48:56]** – please, enquire into this;

**[00:48:58]** perhaps,
this is something new to you –

**[00:49:02]** in which there is not
a shadow of control?

**[00:49:07]** So to find that out one has to ask:
who is the controller?

**[00:49:13]** Right?

**[00:49:19]** We are enquiring
into what is meditation,

**[00:49:25]** because perhaps if one can
understand the nature of meditation,

**[00:49:31]** not the meaning of the word

**[00:49:33]** – the meaning of the word
is very simple:

**[00:49:35]** to ponder, to think over,
to enquire and so on, so on –

**[00:49:41]** but apart from the word,
to find out what is meditation.

**[00:49:50]** It may, in this enquiry,

**[00:49:54]** resolve, bring about a life

**[00:49:57]** which is extraordinarily sane,
extraordinarily rational,

**[00:50:10]** and may be able to find out

**[00:50:13]** something that is nameless,
timeless.

**[00:50:17]** We are leading to that.

**[00:50:22]** So who is the controller

**[00:50:25]** who says,
‘I must control my feelings’,

**[00:50:28]** or ‘I must allow my feelings
to flow’, and so on,

**[00:50:34]** who is that entity that says,
‘I must control’?

**[00:50:42]** You understand?
Control and the controlled.

**[00:50:47]** The controller
and the thing to be controlled.

**[00:50:51]** So there is a division.

**[00:50:54]** Who is this controller?

**[00:50:57]** Is it not still
the movement of thought?

**[00:51:02]** Thought has said
– please, follow this –

**[00:51:06]** thought has said,

**[00:51:08]** ‘I have experienced this,
I have learned this’,

**[00:51:11]** all the rest of it,
which is the past,

**[00:51:13]** so the past is the controller.

**[00:51:17]** Right?

**[00:51:19]** And that which is happening now

**[00:51:23]** has to be controlled
by the controller.

**[00:51:25]** Right?
You understand?

**[00:51:30]** Are you following all this?

**[00:51:32]** Or you are just going to sleep?

**[00:51:35]** Questioner: Following.

**[00:51:39]** K: Actually doing it, sir.

**[00:51:41]** I am not talking for my benefit.
Right?

**[00:51:45]** I have talked for 52 years
– ‘basta’ for me.

**[00:51:51]** I am not interested in talking.

**[00:51:55]** But I am interested to find out

**[00:51:56]** if you can also
discover the same thing,

**[00:52:02]** so that your own life will be
totally different, transformed,

**[00:52:09]** so that you have
no problems, no complexities,

**[00:52:12]** no strife, longings,
all the rest of it.

**[00:52:19]** That is the reason
the speaker is talking,

**[00:52:23]** not for his own gratification,
not for his own enjoyment

**[00:52:26]** or for his own fulfilment
– all that nonsense.

**[00:52:35]** So the controller is
the result of thought,

**[00:52:41]** thought based upon knowledge,
which is the past.

**[00:52:47]** And that thought says,

**[00:52:50]** ‘I must control that
which is happening now’ – right?

**[00:52:56]** The actual.

**[00:52:58]** The actual is being,
say, for example,

**[00:53:02]** envy or jealousy,
which you all know.

**[00:53:09]** And thought says,
‘I must control’.

**[00:53:11]** ‘I must analyse.
I must suppress it, or fulfil it’.

**[00:53:16]** So there is a division
– right? –

**[00:53:19]** the division created by thought.

**[00:53:24]** Are you following?

**[00:53:25]** So in this there is deception.

**[00:53:33]** Right?

**[00:53:35]** The deception lies in the idea

**[00:53:39]** that the controller
is different from that

**[00:53:41]** which is to be controlled.

**[00:53:45]** Both are created by thought.

**[00:53:49]** Right?

**[00:53:51]** So the controller
is the controlled.

**[00:53:56]** I wonder if you see this.

**[00:53:59]** Right?

**[00:54:04]** So if you really
understand this,

**[00:54:06]** go into this very seriously
for yourself,

**[00:54:10]** you will see that

**[00:54:12]** the controller is unnecessary,
only observation is necessary.

**[00:54:20]** You understand?

**[00:54:23]** When you observe,

**[00:54:26]** there is no controller
or the controlled,

**[00:54:29]** just observing.

**[00:54:31]** Observing your envy,
say, for example, envy,

**[00:54:36]** observe it,

**[00:54:42]** without naming it,

**[00:54:46]** without denying it or accepting it,

**[00:54:49]** just to see, the sensation,
this reaction,

**[00:54:55]** which arises,
which has been called envy,

**[00:54:59]** and to look at it without the word.

**[00:55:04]** You are following all this?

**[00:55:08]** Then when there is no word,

**[00:55:13]** because the word
represents the past

**[00:55:18]** – you are following all this?

**[00:55:20]** and when you use the word ‘envy’,
it strengthens the past.

**[00:55:30]** Right?

**[00:55:33]** So there is a possibility of living
without any sense of control.

**[00:55:42]** I am saying this not as a theory
but actually.

**[00:55:51]** The speaker says
what he has done,

**[00:55:56]** not what he invents,

**[00:56:02]** that there is a life
without any sense of control

**[00:56:10]** and therefore no sense of conflict,
no sense of division.

**[00:56:17]** That can only come into being

**[00:56:20]** when there is only pure observation.

**[00:56:24]** Got it?
Do it and you will see.

**[00:56:27]** Do it!
Test it out.

**[00:56:36]** When there is no conflict
whatsoever,

**[00:56:41]** what takes place in the mind?

**[00:56:47]** You understand?

**[00:56:51]** Conflict implies movement.
Right?

**[00:56:58]** Movement is time.

**[00:57:03]** Right?

**[00:57:05]** Time being from here to there,

**[00:57:08]** both physically and psychologically.

**[00:57:15]** That is,

**[00:57:18]** the movement from the centre
to another centre

**[00:57:26]** or the movement from the periphery
to another – you follow?

**[00:57:30]** There is this constant movement
in all of us.

**[00:57:36]** Now if you observe this movement
very carefully,

**[00:57:43]** and as you observe,
what takes place in the mind?

**[00:57:48]** You are following all this?

**[00:57:53]** First, you have understood,
no authority,

**[00:57:57]** the nature of thought,

**[00:58:02]** thought being limited,

**[00:58:04]** and knowledge

**[00:58:06]** which is stored up in the brain
as memory,

**[00:58:11]** and that memory acting
as thought in action.

**[00:58:16]** So knowledge is always
part of ignorance.

**[00:58:22]** Right?
We went into that.

**[00:58:26]** So what takes place in the mind?

**[00:58:34]** You understand?

**[00:58:35]** The mind as we have gone into it,

**[00:58:40]** is not only the capacity
to think clearly,

**[00:58:45]** objectively, impersonally,

**[00:58:51]** and the things that thought
has created, technologically,

**[00:58:56]** all the rest of it in the world,

**[00:58:58]** and thought has also created
all the inward problems.

**[00:59:03]** Right?

**[00:59:07]** When one observes all this,

**[00:59:10]** the mind has the capacity
to act not from thought

**[00:59:18]** but from pure observation.

**[00:59:22]** Do you get this?
I wonder if you understand all this!

**[00:59:27]** Please, sirs, all this is logical,
is nothing sectarian,

**[00:59:33]** nothing, Eastern philosophy
– none of that.

**[00:59:42]** Though the speaker is born
in that country called India,

**[00:59:46]** he is not an Indian.

**[00:59:50]** He has got a passport,
that is all.

**[00:59:54]** So he is not involved
in exotic romantic nonsense,

**[01:00:01]** or some strange philosophy.

**[01:00:05]** We are only examining
what is actually taking place.

**[01:00:13]** And to observe
what is actually taking place,

**[01:00:18]** one must look

**[01:00:22]** without the response of the past
shaping it.

**[01:00:28]** From that pure observation
there is action.

**[01:00:34]** That is intelligence.

**[01:00:36]** And that is also the extraordinary
thing called love and compassion.

**[01:00:46]** So the mind has
this quality of intelligence,

**[01:00:50]** and naturally,

**[01:00:53]** with that intelligence
goes compassion, love.

**[01:00:59]** Love is not mere sex –
for god’s sake, brush all that.

**[01:01:04]** Love is something
other than mere sensation,

**[01:01:13]** totally unrelated
to our demands and fulfilments,

**[01:01:19]** and all the rest of it.

**[01:01:23]** So the mind now has
this quality, this stability.

**[01:01:34]** It is like a rock
in the midst of a stream,

**[01:01:39]** in the midst of a river,
immovable.

**[01:01:43]** Everything...
You follow?

**[01:01:45]** So such a mind,

**[01:01:49]** because it has understood
relationship with each other

**[01:01:53]** – we went into that –

**[01:01:54]** relationship is not based on image
– you understand? –

**[01:01:59]** you have an image about me,
and I have an image about her,

**[01:02:05]** and our relationship is that:
from image to image.

**[01:02:10]** You know all this, don’t you?

**[01:02:15]** And therefore there is
no actual relationship.

**[01:02:21]** There may be the relationship
of touch, of the senses,

**[01:02:27]** but that is not actual deep,

**[01:02:32]** profound relationship with another.

**[01:02:38]** If there is not that
profound relationship,

**[01:02:42]** there is conflict,

**[01:02:44]** and out of that conflict
we create this society

**[01:02:48]** which is utterly immoral,
violent, murderous.

**[01:02:59]** So the mind now has
this quality of great stability.

**[01:03:11]** And that which is stable
is silent.

**[01:03:18]** Right?

**[01:03:21]** Are you following all this?

**[01:03:24]** Have you gone into this?
You understand?

**[01:03:32]** To be absolutely clear,

**[01:03:39]** to have clarity which can then
examine any problem.

**[01:03:46]** That clarity is stability.

**[01:03:51]** You understand?

**[01:03:52]** It is only the mind that is
confused, contradictory, broken-up,

**[01:03:58]** that is unstable, neurotic,

**[01:04:02]** seeking, striving, struggling.

**[01:04:09]** So we come to a point
where the mind is totally clear

**[01:04:16]** and therefore
completely immovable.

**[01:04:22]** You understand?

**[01:04:24]** Immovable not
in the sense of a mountain,

**[01:04:29]** but immovable in the sense
that it is so completely…

**[01:04:39]** has no problem, no...
– you follow? – all that,

**[01:04:43]** therefore it is extraordinarily
stable and therefore pliable.

**[01:04:49]** Right?

**[01:04:52]** Now: such a mind is quiet.

**[01:04:58]** And you need to have a mind
that is absolutely silent

**[01:05:07]** – absolutely, not relatively –

**[01:05:11]** there is the silence when you go
of an evening in the woods,

**[01:05:20]** there is great silence,

**[01:05:23]** all the birds have gone to bed,

**[01:05:27]** the wind, the whisper of the leaves
has ended,

**[01:05:31]** there is great stillness,

**[01:05:36]** there is the outward stillness.

**[01:05:39]** And people observe that stillness

**[01:05:43]** and say,
‘I must have that stillness’,

**[01:05:47]** and therefore depend
on the stillness of being alone

**[01:05:54]** – you understand? –
being in solitude.

**[01:06:00]** That is not stillness.

**[01:06:05]** And there is the stillness
created by thought.

**[01:06:15]** Which is, thought says,
‘I must be still,

**[01:06:20]** I must be quiet,
I mustn’t chatter’,

**[01:06:28]** and gradually it produces
a stillness.

**[01:06:33]** But that is not it,

**[01:06:35]** because it is the result
of thought operating on noise.

**[01:06:43]** Right?

**[01:06:45]** So we are talking of a stillness
which is not dependent on anything.

**[01:06:55]** And it is only
that quality of stillness,

**[01:07:00]** that absolute silence
of the mind

**[01:07:06]** that can see that which is eternal,
timeless, nameless.

**[01:07:14]** This is meditation.

**[01:07:20]** Right?

**[01:07:36]** Right, sirs.

**[01:07:38]** Finished.
