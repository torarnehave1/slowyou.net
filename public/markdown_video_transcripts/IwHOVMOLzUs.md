**[00:00:20]** Krishnamurti:
I think we have to make a resume

**[00:00:26]** of what we talked about yesterday.

**[00:00:32]** Is it loud enough?

**[00:00:37]** Am I talking loudly?
That’s better.

**[00:00:46]** We started talking about education,

**[00:00:55]** how to educate one’s son or daughter
to face this very ugly world,

**[00:01:03]** which is becoming
more and more dangerous.

**[00:01:09]** What do we mean by that education?

**[00:01:15]** To help the child to conform

**[00:01:19]** to the pattern
of the existing society,

**[00:01:28]** or face the future in a different
manner, different dimension?

**[00:01:39]** That’s one point
we raised yesterday morning.

**[00:01:43]** The other was to educate oneself
so as to educate the child.

**[00:01:51]** What do we mean
by that education?

**[00:01:58]** What is one educating for?

**[00:02:10]** To conform, or to transcend
the present situation

**[00:02:14]** and go much further?

**[00:02:16]** That’s another point
we talked about yesterday.

**[00:02:20]** The other was, also

**[00:02:26]** – wait a minute –

**[00:02:28]** human consciousness
is more or less similar

**[00:02:34]** to all the consciousness of mankind.

**[00:02:39]** Our consciousness,
one’s particular consciousness,

**[00:02:44]** is not different
from the consciousness of a person

**[00:02:48]** who is a thousand miles away
or nearby,

**[00:02:54]** because all human beings suffer,
go through a great deal of anxiety,

**[00:03:02]** sorrow and all the travail of life.

**[00:03:08]** And so, we came to the point that
we are actually not individuals.

**[00:03:16]** I know most of people
will object to that.

**[00:03:21]** And also, we said

**[00:03:26]** if there is a change
in the consciousness of a person,

**[00:03:30]** it affects the whole
of consciousness of mankind.

**[00:03:35]** And also, we talked
about not seeking a cause.

**[00:03:43]** The analysts are always
searching for a cause

**[00:03:49]** and trying to alter the effect.

**[00:03:54]** The universe has no cause.

**[00:03:58]** Can human beings live
without a cause?

**[00:04:02]** That’s where we left off,
if I remember rightly.

**[00:04:06]** If I have not said all the things
which we discussed yesterday,

**[00:04:11]** please, you correct it,
you join in.

**[00:04:17]** Right?

**[00:04:22]** Do we proceed from there?

**[00:04:26]** Q: The word ‘time’ was mentioned
on a number of occasions yesterday.

**[00:04:30]** K: Oh, yes, yes.

**[00:04:36]** Do we need time to change,
to transform ourselves?

**[00:04:41]** To study ourselves, gradually
altering ourselves bit by bit.

**[00:04:50]** Or, not thinking
in terms of time at all,

**[00:04:56]** is there a possibility of immediate
freedom from conditioning?

**[00:05:03]** That’s more or less
where we left off.

**[00:05:09]** Q: This poses a great difficulty.

**[00:05:15]** It implies that one has to enter
into another dimension.

**[00:05:24]** That which speaks doesn’t seem
to have any capacity

**[00:05:30]** to enter into this other dimension.

**[00:05:36]** The pheasant in the field over there
is perfectly capable of flying.

**[00:05:43]** It’s rather like expecting one
to depart into another dimension.

**[00:05:50]** This question of capacity
creates an impasse:

**[00:05:56]** What is it that enters
the other dimension?

**[00:06:03]** K: Go on. The discussion is open,
not for me alone.

**[00:06:10]** Q: I seem to remember
that we came yesterday to the end…

**[00:06:14]** K: I’m not the Chairman, sir.

**[00:06:18]** Q: We came to a point where
you were talking about attachment

**[00:06:21]** and about going into attachment.

**[00:06:24]** Not with explanations,
whys and wherefores,

**[00:06:27]** but you seemed to intimate
or go into that.

**[00:06:30]** It’s the same sort of statement
of the difficulty.

**[00:06:36]** A difficulty I have, too.

**[00:06:39]** Q: Another difficulty is that we
idealise the process of education

**[00:06:44]** as a panacea,
as a means to salvation.

**[00:06:49]** Why do we have
to emphasise education?

**[00:07:01]** K: That was the subject we chose.
We can change the subject.

**[00:07:07]** Q: No, at least,
we should define it,

**[00:07:11]** clearly.

**[00:07:13]** Q: Could I ask that people
lift their voice and project it

**[00:07:19]** because, otherwise,
the rest of us don’t hear.

**[00:07:27]** Q: I had been wondering
why you were so much concerned

**[00:07:32]** with this matter of change
with outside time.

**[00:07:37]** Then I thought maybe
what you are going to come to

**[00:07:42]** is that education is not a process.
K: No, that’s just it.

**[00:07:47]** Q: Then I thought,
what does this mean?

**[00:07:52]** I felt that just
as a transformation of consciousness

**[00:08:01]** is not likely to happen
if one is heavily conditioned,

**[00:08:06]** it will also be difficult in a bad
so-called educational system?

**[00:08:16]** So, correspondingly,
if a human being is growing up

**[00:08:24]** in loving relationships with, say,
their parents and teachers,

**[00:08:31]** based, from one instant to the next,

**[00:08:35]** on understanding
and openness of mind,

**[00:08:40]** in that state of living,
that relationship,

**[00:08:47]** it is more likely that thing
can happen instantaneously.

**[00:08:55]** It would seem that true education
can’t be separated from good living,

**[00:09:06]** that one is part
and parcel of the other.

**[00:09:12]** If the parent or the teacher or
any one human being or the other,

**[00:09:18]** in relating to another human being
has this loving understanding,

**[00:09:26]** then that is all that one can do,
to see what is there

**[00:09:33]** and to exchange one’s thoughts

**[00:09:39]** and to hope

**[00:09:45]** that one will have these
instantaneous transformations.

**[00:09:54]** K: Sir, but I don’t love.

**[00:10:00]** I’m a wounded person.

**[00:10:04]** I’ve got so many problems
in my life.

**[00:10:10]** I hate people – not personally,
I’m just taking it as an example –

**[00:10:14]** I hate people,

**[00:10:17]** I have battles with my wife,
I’m selfish

**[00:10:23]** – in that state,
how can I love somebody?

**[00:10:30]** Q: Are you posing
a question of somebody

**[00:10:33]** surrounded with conditions
and problems,

**[00:10:37]** ‘What can they do?’

**[00:10:41]** K: I didn’t quite hear, sir.

**[00:10:44]** Q: You’re posing the question of
a person surrounded with problems.

**[00:10:49]** K: That’s right.

**[00:10:50]** Q: Personal problems
and malfunctions.

**[00:10:54]** And what can they do?

**[00:10:56]** K: That’s the whole point.

**[00:10:59]** Q: That is your question.

**[00:11:01]** Q: What such a person normally does

**[00:11:05]** is try to short-circuit
the education in time

**[00:11:12]** by means of prescriptions
and prohibitions.

**[00:11:16]** This is normally the idea
of an educational system

**[00:11:22]** from somebody who hasn’t enough time
to devote to the type of education

**[00:11:26]** that Dr Wilkins was talking about.

**[00:11:37]** Q: If education is to transmit
information and experience,

**[00:11:44]** is it not a process of conditioning,

**[00:11:48]** therefore inhibiting the growth
of the person who is being educated?

**[00:11:55]** If on the other hand, we consider
that the educator is also learning,

**[00:12:01]** educating himself simultaneously,

**[00:12:04]** it becomes a more encompassing.

**[00:12:10]** K: Sir, biologically
there is growth.

**[00:12:15]** Is there growth psychologically?
That’s the whole point.

**[00:12:21]** Do I become something?

**[00:12:30]** To become something involves time

**[00:12:36]** and values,

**[00:12:39]** comparative existence.

**[00:12:43]** To become something
involves conflict,

**[00:12:48]** time and all the struggle
that one goes through.

**[00:12:56]** Q: Is education to make people
become something?

**[00:12:59]** K: That’s what is happening now.

**[00:13:02]** We are taking it as it is,
not imagining what should be.

**[00:13:10]** Q: That’s what I’m saying,
that education is not education.

**[00:13:15]** K: You may not think so,
but it is.

**[00:13:19]** So, how do we parents or educators
transcend all that?

**[00:13:28]** If that is what is right or true.

**[00:13:37]** Q: Sir, I’d like to ask
what is order?

**[00:13:42]** It seems that the question of order
is closely connected with education.

**[00:13:53]** K: Please, answer it.

**[00:13:58]** Q: Krishnaji, I find this discussion
difficult to follow

**[00:14:03]** because we seem to be talking
at two different levels.

**[00:14:07]** Some of us are talking
about the individual

**[00:14:09]** adapting to the pressures
that society puts on him,

**[00:14:13]** and others are suggesting
that maybe there is a way,

**[00:14:17]** that as individuals we can influence
the way society operates

**[00:14:23]** so that ultimately we can change it,
for one we approve of.

**[00:14:31]** It’s this difference
between the two levels

**[00:14:33]** I find difficult to reconcile.

**[00:14:37]** K: Let us stick to one level, sir,
then, shall we?

**[00:14:42]** Q: I’d be more comfortable
with that,

**[00:14:45]** but I can see they do interact
in ways that are unpredictable.

**[00:14:52]** As individuals,
we want to change society.

**[00:14:58]** We understand
certain characteristics

**[00:15:02]** of the educational system.

**[00:15:04]** We suggest that the current
system of formal education

**[00:15:10]** seems to emphasise
qualities in human conduct

**[00:15:13]** which are divisive and destructive,

**[00:15:16]** and from that we decide
we want to change this.

**[00:15:21]** But as individuals we’re not
powerful enough to make an impact.

**[00:15:29]** K: That’s why, sir,
we said yesterday too,

**[00:15:35]** the common ground of all human
beings is self-centred activity.

**[00:15:43]** That’s a fact.

**[00:15:45]** And education is helping them
to become more and more self-centred

**[00:15:53]** – specialists, surgeons –

**[00:15:56]** the whole system is helping
each human being

**[00:16:04]** to become more acquisitive,
more self-centred,

**[00:16:09]** and act from there.

**[00:16:14]** Is education now encouraging that?

**[00:16:19]** If so, is it possible
to break through that, immediately?

**[00:16:28]** We are still remaining
on the same level, not two levels.

**[00:16:33]** Q: But is there another distinction?

**[00:16:37]** You talk about
instantaneous transformation.

**[00:16:42]** For the individual consciousness,
that makes it very meaningful,

**[00:16:48]** but if you talk about the whole
social system, educational system,

**[00:16:54]** it seems one can’t expect that
to change instantaneously.

**[00:16:59]** Only through
individual transformations

**[00:17:03]** can the whole change.

**[00:17:10]** Q: A lot of us aren’t sure that
selfishness or competition is bad,

**[00:17:16]** because we’ve seen science prosper
on the basis of individual striving.

**[00:17:26]** Through competition, we’ve had
tremendous technological success.

**[00:17:32]** So, there is this question

**[00:17:35]** whether self-centred activity
is all that bad

**[00:17:40]** at the individual level
that you’re talking about.

**[00:17:46]** I don’t know
if I make myself clear.

**[00:17:49]** Q: Correspondingly, one can say
that war is not all that bad,

**[00:17:53]** that in history war has been a
useful instrument of foreign policy.

**[00:17:58]** But one doesn’t support war.
K: Quite right.

**[00:18:03]** Q: But we also said that competition
destroys a person psychologically.

**[00:18:13]** I don’t know how you can say
that competition makes one…

**[00:18:18]** You may discover something
through competing, driving yourself,

**[00:18:26]** but as a human being, one becomes
destroyed at the end of one’s life,

**[00:18:30]** through that competition.

**[00:18:34]** K: The two great powers,
America and Russia, are competing,

**[00:18:39]** and we’re all going to suffer.

**[00:18:42]** Q: But one of them will benefit.

**[00:18:46]** K: How?

**[00:18:50]** Q: I don’t necessarily
believe in this

**[00:18:52]** but I’m just placing that argument

**[00:18:54]** that is so compulsive at times.

**[00:18:59]** K: Let’s be clear, sir.

**[00:19:01]** Do we intellectually
argue about all this

**[00:19:09]** – I’m not saying we should not –

**[00:19:11]** or examine the question
much more profoundly?

**[00:19:24]** As we started yesterday,
I have got several children.

**[00:19:30]** What am I to do with them,
and what am I to do with myself?

**[00:19:34]** That’s the real question
I’m talking about.

**[00:19:40]** I’m selfish, I have
a tremendous lot of problems,

**[00:19:45]** – I’m talking generally –

**[00:19:48]** and my son and daughter
have problems too.

**[00:19:58]** So, how am I to deal with all this?

**[00:20:04]** Q: Yesterday, we began talking about
the difference between just hearing

**[00:20:10]** or knowing some phrase
and actually seeing it as a fact.

**[00:20:14]** The seeing of something as a fact

**[00:20:18]** was crucial to what a real education
was all about.

**[00:20:22]** We just came to talking
about what is involved

**[00:20:26]** in this truly seeing
something as a fact

**[00:20:29]** when we moved away.
Could we come back to that?

**[00:20:34]** K: The ‘what is’
and the idea of what is.

**[00:20:40]** Is that it?
Q: How does on truly see ‘what is’?

**[00:20:45]** Otherwise, there is
no real learning taking place,

**[00:20:49]** for my children or for myself.

**[00:20:52]** Q: You spoke also
of being aware of attachment,

**[00:20:56]** not through looking at the history
or the time factor,

**[00:21:01]** but seeing it in a way
that you equated with insight.

**[00:21:06]** The implication being
that that kind of seeing,

**[00:21:10]** which is an entirely
different order than the usual,

**[00:21:13]** was the factor of change.
K: That’s right.

**[00:21:18]** Q: We ended on that note.

**[00:21:23]** K: Continue with that?
Q: Yes.

**[00:21:34]** K: We have to go into the whole
question of knowledge. Right?

**[00:21:39]** What place has knowledge
in human life?

**[00:21:47]** Will knowledge help man
to be unselfish, not self-centred?

**[00:22:00]** And what place has knowledge
in relationship?

**[00:22:06]** All that is implied.
Knowledge being, all that.

**[00:22:10]** Need I go through all that?

**[00:22:14]** Knowledge being experience,

**[00:22:18]** whether it’s personal
or inherited or traditional.

**[00:22:26]** From that knowledge, which is stored
in the brain, in the human mind,

**[00:22:33]** and from that knowledge,
memory, thought, action.

**[00:22:42]** In that cycle, we are caught.

**[00:22:47]** Experience, knowledge,
memory, thought, action.

**[00:22:54]** This is the chain or cadre,

**[00:23:00]** framework in which we operate.
Q: Every moment of the day.

**[00:23:06]** K: Every moment of the day.
That’s what computers are doing.

**[00:23:13]** Wait, that’s what
the computer is doing.

**[00:23:17]** Programmed.

**[00:23:19]** It can learn, unlearn,
create a new machine,

**[00:23:24]** till it reaches
the ultra-intelligent machine.

**[00:23:29]** Right? You know about it.

**[00:23:32]** I’ve talked to friends,
so I talk about it glibly.

**[00:23:35]** I don’t know sufficiently about it,
but I’ve gone into it a little.

**[00:23:40]** So, the computer can out-think man.

**[00:23:48]** We have become like that – machines.

**[00:23:59]** Education is apparently
to continue in that pattern.

**[00:24:04]** Q: Programming.

**[00:24:07]** K: I’m a Catholic,
I’m a Protestant, I’m British,

**[00:24:10]** I’m a scientist – whatever –
I’m a guru.

**[00:24:14]** The whole thing is that.

**[00:24:18]** Now, taking the example
of attachment

**[00:24:29]** – attachment to my wife, my belief,
to my God, to my experience

**[00:24:34]** – whatever it is –
attachment to my knowledge,

**[00:24:38]** attachment invariably
breeds corruption.

**[00:24:43]** We’ve said that.
We went into it a little.

**[00:24:48]** To transcend that, is it necessary
to find out why I am attached?

**[00:25:01]** Which means
thinking in terms of time.

**[00:25:07]** Time being, examining
from the storehouse of my knowledge.

**[00:25:16]** So, I’m repeating the same pattern

**[00:25:18]** when I analyse and
try to find the cause of something.

**[00:25:23]** I don’t know if I’m explaining this
clearly or not.

**[00:25:33]** As long as I have a cause,

**[00:25:37]** that demands not only an effect
but an end.

**[00:25:44]** Right?

**[00:25:46]** Insight,
as we talked about yesterday,

**[00:25:50]** is not related to time
or cause or memory.

**[00:25:59]** Having direct perception of it,
immediately,

**[00:26:06]** and that immediate perception acts.

**[00:26:14]** Q: Can we say that that perception
looks at the actual thing as it is

**[00:26:20]** without going into any derivation?

**[00:26:22]** It’s what it’s doing in that moment
in the human psyche,

**[00:26:27]** without any background.

**[00:26:29]** The background is unnecessary.
K: Is that possible?

**[00:26:34]** The scientists, the artists,

**[00:26:38]** all those people
have a partial insight.

**[00:26:46]** My statement needs examination
and doubt, questioning.

**[00:26:49]** Please, let’s talk about it
and then we’ll go into it.

**[00:26:54]** Q: But isn’t that partial insight,
the result of a long preparation?

**[00:26:59]** K: No, no.

**[00:27:00]** Q: The scientist has
years and years of preparation.

**[00:27:04]** K: That’s why it’s partial.
Q: That’s right.

**[00:27:08]** Q: Also, in ordinary,
everyday confronting problems,

**[00:27:12]** don’t most people
get hypnotised by the problem

**[00:27:16]** as they are involved in it.
They can’t look at it differently

**[00:27:21]** except by trying to go behind it,
and say why it happened, etc.?

**[00:27:27]** This quality of insight is totally
different from the usual thing –

**[00:27:34]** people saying, ‘I’m afraid of this,
afraid of that’,

**[00:27:37]** and there’s no insight in that.

**[00:27:39]** There is looking at the effect,
the action in that moment,

**[00:27:42]** but without any changing quality.

**[00:27:45]** K: So, what is the question?

**[00:27:47]** Q: What is the quality of looking,
which you call insight,

**[00:27:53]** which differs radically
from what we all do,

**[00:27:57]** which is look at our problems?

**[00:28:00]** There’s the psychiatric way
of trying to understand it,

**[00:28:04]** the roots of it,

**[00:28:05]** but without that,
most people are stuck with it,

**[00:28:10]** looking at the problem.

**[00:28:13]** You’re talking about
something entirely different.

**[00:28:15]** K: Take a problem
and let’s look at it.

**[00:28:18]** Q: May I elaborate on that,
Krishnaji?

**[00:28:23]** What you said just beforehand,
‘Attachment breeds corruption’.

**[00:28:32]** You talk about staying with that
fact or statement or holding it.

**[00:28:38]** You’re talking
about such a special thing.

**[00:28:43]** It’s not something simple.

**[00:28:46]** I can’t just say,
‘Just stay with the fact’,

**[00:28:48]** because it’s something
quite foreign to me.

**[00:28:53]** To stay with a fact
or to stay with a statement,

**[00:28:56]** to hold it in such a way
that it becomes a fact…

**[00:29:00]** K: Not becomes a fact.
Let’s say I am violent.

**[00:29:05]** Q: But one is transformed
by the truth of that thing.

**[00:29:09]** K: I understand. Let’s look
at an example. I am violent.

**[00:29:17]** My reaction to violence
is either to express it

**[00:29:27]** or various forms of escape from it,

**[00:29:32]** or say, ‘Why shouldn’t
I be violent?’

**[00:29:35]** and indulge in it.

**[00:29:37]** Q: May I add another one?
K: Add some more.

**[00:29:41]** Q: There’s hearing that and saying,
‘Yes, I am violent’,

**[00:29:46]** and seeing that it is partially true
but not seeing it so that it ends.

**[00:29:51]** K: No, wait, wait.
I am violent.

**[00:29:57]** I examine, I look at the word,
which may awaken violence,

**[00:30:06]** the word itself.

**[00:30:09]** Which is to recognise
from former experiences

**[00:30:13]** that reaction,
which is called violence.

**[00:30:18]** Right?

**[00:30:20]** And I have been educated
not to be violent.

**[00:30:29]** ‘It’s good not to be violent’.

**[00:30:32]** So, I’ve got two reactions now,
violence and not to be violent.

**[00:30:39]** Now, which is a fact?

**[00:30:43]** Q: Violence.

**[00:30:45]** K: That’s the only fact.
The other is non-fact.

**[00:30:50]** Q: To be educated
not to be violent, is violence.

**[00:30:55]** K: I’m coming to that.

**[00:30:59]** I’ve only one fact,
which is I am violent.

**[00:31:03]** The other is not a fact.

**[00:31:06]** Therefore, what I call fact
is also part of my education,

**[00:31:13]** part of my upbringing,
part of my social impressions

**[00:31:19]** and pressures and inhibitions
– the whole of it.

**[00:31:23]** Now, can I remain with that fact
without escaping? Just be with it.

**[00:31:35]** It’s a fact, I’m violent.
Be with it.

**[00:31:38]** Don’t analyse. Don’t escape from it.
Don’t seek the cause of it.

**[00:31:45]** Just hold it in your hand and look.

**[00:31:49]** Q: Can we say more about that?

**[00:31:53]** Is there any more one can say
about just being with it

**[00:31:56]** and holding it in your hand?

**[00:32:00]** Can we look at that?

**[00:32:02]** Q: And how long?
K: For how long?

**[00:32:08]** Q: The person who is
obsessive or delusionary

**[00:32:13]** or consumed with anger or fear,

**[00:32:17]** is, in his sense, doing that.

**[00:32:19]** You’re talking about something else.

**[00:32:22]** They are in that fear,
that delusion, that obsession.

**[00:32:27]** K: I am not sure they are in that.

**[00:32:32]** Q: In what?

**[00:32:39]** K: In that state of awareness
in which they are frightened, fear.

**[00:32:49]** They may be escaping from it,
running,

**[00:32:52]** various forms of avoidance of it.

**[00:32:56]** May I ask, what is it
we are talking about, now?

**[00:33:00]** Q: I think we are talking about
that particular instant of holding

**[00:33:11]** and being with a thing
like our violence or our fear.

**[00:33:16]** What is the nature of that…?

**[00:33:19]** K: …holding.
I’ll tell you.

**[00:33:23]** Q: We are talking
about the nature of ‘what is’.

**[00:33:29]** Q: But violence, anger
is the way of life we live.

**[00:33:34]** K: Yes, that’s the way we live.
What is it you are trying to say?

**[00:33:40]** Q: That’s where
we have to penetrate.

**[00:33:45]** K: We are trying to do that now.

**[00:33:49]** I am violent
or I’m in sorrow.

**[00:33:59]** Something happens to my son
or brother or my wife,

**[00:34:04]** and I’m in sorrow.

**[00:34:10]** When there is sorrow, I’m trying
to escape from it, through comfort.

**[00:34:16]** I want some kind of comfort
because I cannot face my loneliness.

**[00:34:23]** Right?

**[00:34:26]** I say, ‘Why am I lonely?’.
I’m seeking the cause of it.

**[00:34:36]** That’s a psycho-analytical process.
I don’t want to enter into that.

**[00:34:41]** I don’t want to seek a cause
or escape from it

**[00:34:45]** or seek comfort for sorrow.

**[00:34:50]** So, I observe that sorrow.

**[00:34:56]** Right? I’m living with it.

**[00:35:00]** In that living, am I an outsider
looking at sorrow, or I am sorrow?

**[00:35:11]** You understand the difference?
Q: Yes.

**[00:35:18]** How do I observe sorrow or violence
or fear or even pleasure?

**[00:35:25]** How do I observe or be aware
of my sorrow? What does it mean?

**[00:35:34]** Am I different from that
which I call sorrow?

**[00:35:42]** Or I am sorrow,
I am not different from it.

**[00:35:48]** Q: So, sorrow has to observe itself.

**[00:35:50]** K: I’m just going into it.
No, no, no.

**[00:35:54]** Let’s go step by step into it.
Q: Generally, it’s the first case.

**[00:36:00]** Sorrow is going on
but I am not sorrow.

**[00:36:05]** K: What do you mean?
Q: Well, it’s going on

**[00:36:10]** but there are other things
or I’m probably something else

**[00:36:13]** or I’m partially that.
K: No, just a minute.

**[00:36:15]** Of course, ordinary life
is going on around you.

**[00:36:22]** Q: I’m not totally that though.
K: Why not? Why?

**[00:36:29]** When my son dies,
it is a great shock – right? –

**[00:36:39]** physical, as well as psychological.

**[00:36:44]** It takes time
to get over that shock.

**[00:36:49]** Things are happening around me
but I’m living in shock.

**[00:36:55]** Right?

**[00:36:58]** Now, that shock I call sorrow.

**[00:37:05]** How do I look at that sorrow?

**[00:37:09]** Things are happening

**[00:37:10]** – I have to eat,
I have go to the office and so on –

**[00:37:13]** leave all that aside for the moment.

**[00:37:14]** How do I observe this sorrow?

**[00:37:21]** Q: One’s sense of self seems
to escape all the time further back,

**[00:37:27]** from a feeling like sorrow.

**[00:37:30]** It’s a continuous escape.
K: You want to withdraw from it.

**[00:37:37]** Q: But facing the fact.
K: That’s what I’m trying to say.

**[00:37:40]** My son is dead.
It is a shock, which I call sorrow,

**[00:37:47]** both physical and psychological,

**[00:37:51]** my reaction to that
is to escape from it, avoid it,

**[00:37:57]** because it is indicating
something tremendous to me,

**[00:38:01]** which I’m incapable,
being presently in shock,

**[00:38:05]** of seeing the whole content of that.

**[00:38:11]** Q: When you say stick with it…
K: I’m coming. Slow, patience.

**[00:38:19]** I’m in that state. Right?
How do I look at this feeling?

**[00:38:28]** Q: But this contradictory feeling
also comes up so quickly...

**[00:38:33]** K: I know all that.
Q: How is one to look at it?

**[00:38:41]** Q: To see yourself as different
from the sorrow is the first escape.

**[00:38:46]** And to see that
you are the sorrow is...

**[00:38:50]** K: That is the point.
You are sorrow.

**[00:38:53]** You are not different from sorrow.

**[00:38:56]** Q: That might be the beginning...
K: That is so. Not ‘might be’.

**[00:39:04]** You are not different from anger,
from greed and envy.

**[00:39:09]** You are that.
Q: I resist that.

**[00:39:14]** I listen to you and say,
‘Yes, that is so’,

**[00:39:17]** but at the same time,
there’s a resistance.

**[00:39:22]** K: There is resistance because
of our education, our tradition,

**[00:39:26]** because I’ve been told,
‘You are different from that.

**[00:39:30]** God is different’,
all the rest of it.

**[00:39:32]** Q: How do we stop the resistance?

**[00:39:38]** K: You don’t stop resistance, sir.
Forget sorrow. Wait a minute.

**[00:39:43]** Watch your resistance.
Why do you resist?

**[00:39:47]** Don’t seek the cause.

**[00:39:51]** Why do you resist?

**[00:39:53]** I won’t say ‘why?’ –
‘why’ means cause.

**[00:39:58]** There is resistance.
Right?

**[00:40:04]** Stay with it.

**[00:40:16]** Q: Can we understand
from what you say

**[00:40:18]** that the usual way of looking at…

**[00:40:21]** K: It’s not what I – no –
you said, ‘what I am saying’.

**[00:40:26]** Please, just a minute.
I am not saying anything.

**[00:40:29]** I’m saying just watch.
Q: But the way we watch wrongly

**[00:40:34]** either involves escape

**[00:40:38]** or the idea of doing something.
There is a separation from it.

**[00:40:43]** Out of this I want to escape
or act or something,

**[00:40:49]** which is away
from looking at the fact.

**[00:40:51]** K: All that arises because there is
division between sorrow and myself.

**[00:40:59]** That division is illusory.
The fact is I am sorrow.

**[00:41:07]** Q: But we’re not seeing that.

**[00:41:10]** Could it also be
that we are too asleep, in a way?

**[00:41:18]** We have no energy.
We are too asleep.

**[00:41:20]** K: Yes, sir.

**[00:41:22]** Q: There is no confrontation because
there is no energy to make it.

**[00:41:28]** K: As that gentleman said,
we resist it,

**[00:41:30]** consciously or unconsciously.

**[00:41:34]** Q: I’ve got the same problem,
Krishnaji.

**[00:41:36]** If you say I am sorrow,
I can accept it poetically.

**[00:41:40]** K: Not poetically.

**[00:41:42]** Q: But rationally it doesn’t seem
to mean very much.

**[00:41:45]** K: Sir, just a minute.

**[00:41:49]** You know what anger is?

**[00:41:52]** Anger.
Are you different from anger?

**[00:41:59]** Q: I recognise anger
as a state of mind.

**[00:42:03]** K: It doesn’t matter
what you call it.

**[00:42:05]** It’s a reaction, isn’t it?

**[00:42:10]** Is that reaction different from you?

**[00:42:15]** Q: It’s a part of me.
It’s within me.

**[00:42:18]** K: Part of you – admit that.

**[00:42:21]** So, you’re part anger, part envy,

**[00:42:27]** part arrogance, part this and that.
So, you make a whole of that.

**[00:42:33]** So, you are anger.

**[00:42:37]** Right?

**[00:42:42]** Gosh, why do we resist
this very simple fact?

**[00:42:47]** Q: But when I resist, the whole
of my conditioning is at risk.

**[00:42:50]** K: Then examine your conditioning,
live with it,

**[00:42:55]** say, ‘I’m conditioned
to think that way’.

**[00:43:01]** Look at it, sir.

**[00:43:04]** Q: But I’m not only anger,
I’m also friendliness.

**[00:43:08]** K: Of course.

**[00:43:10]** You are angry, you are friendly,
hating, you do all kinds of things.

**[00:43:15]** You are all that.

**[00:43:19]** Q: Isn’t it probably
that first of all,

**[00:43:22]** when anger arises
we’re not aware of it, even.

**[00:43:25]** We become aware of it,
then separation take place.

**[00:43:29]** K: Why should separation take place?
I won’t use the word ‘why’.

**[00:43:36]** Separation takes place.
Look at it.

**[00:43:42]** What is this?

**[00:43:48]** Separation takes place.

**[00:43:52]** Thought says, ‘I am different
from what I am looking at’.

**[00:43:58]** Q: That separation
comes automatically.

**[00:44:06]** K: So, what am I to do?

**[00:44:10]** Q: It’s automatic
from our education.

**[00:44:15]** K: So, what then?

**[00:44:18]** You see, we keep on repeating,
it’s automatic from my education,

**[00:44:22]** I’m conditioned that way,
I cannot look at it differently.

**[00:44:26]** So, we keep repeating it.

**[00:44:29]** Q: I wonder if we could
go back to this ‘I am sorrow’.

**[00:44:34]** Now, I think there is
a real difficulty there

**[00:44:38]** and some people will say

**[00:44:40]** they can see
what this means poetically,

**[00:44:43]** but that means
that in certain other senses,

**[00:44:48]** they don’t see what it means.

**[00:44:50]** Now, do you mean
that you are overcome

**[00:44:59]** and at the mercy of the sorrow,
that it envelops you

**[00:45:06]** and that you cannot regard it
as just part of you?

**[00:45:12]** If we take conditioning,
in general,

**[00:45:16]** conditioning is surely essential
to human beings’ existence,

**[00:45:21]** but the trouble with it is
that it takes you over

**[00:45:25]** and dominates one,

**[00:45:27]** and that’s when it is the trouble.

**[00:45:31]** K: So, do I accept my conditioning?

**[00:45:36]** Q: I think that one must accept it,
in one sense.

**[00:45:40]** K: In one sense, yes.
Q: As a computer,

**[00:45:43]** we must be like computers
and have programs,

**[00:45:45]** but we mustn’t let
those programs run us.

**[00:45:49]** That’s surely
what you are objecting to.

**[00:45:52]** K: Just a minute, sir.

**[00:45:55]** I have been programmed
for 5,000 years as a Brahmin.

**[00:46:02]** I’ve been conditioned that way.
I am that conditioning.

**[00:46:09]** That conditioning
is not different from me.

**[00:46:13]** Q: You are saying that every moment
we continue that conditioning.

**[00:46:18]** You are opening my mind to a choice
that says we don’t have to.

**[00:46:24]** K: The language I speak
has conditioned me. Right?

**[00:46:30]** The clothes, the food,
at a certain level,

**[00:46:35]** in a certain way,
it has conditioned me.

**[00:46:37]** But psychologically,
I’m objecting to being conditioned.

**[00:46:43]** Is it possible
not to be conditioned?

**[00:46:46]** Q: But isn’t part of the program of
that conditioning to protect itself?

**[00:46:51]** Isn’t that
how the resistance comes about,

**[00:46:54]** that the conditioning doesn’t want
itself to be destroyed or ended?

**[00:47:03]** K: Does it protect one?
Q: Itself.

**[00:47:07]** The conditioning protects itself.

**[00:47:10]** Q: A sense of security.
K: Does it?

**[00:47:14]** Or I am different
from my conditioning

**[00:47:17]** and thought says,
‘I must protect myself’.

**[00:47:22]** Q: Yes, but what is thought?
It’s all conditioning.

**[00:47:26]** Q: The very things
we’re saying here, the language.

**[00:47:31]** We shouldn’t be dominated
by the conditioning.

**[00:47:36]** K: Maria, could we stop a minute?
Q: We’re saying we are the program.

**[00:47:40]** K: What is it we’re talking about?
Let’s come back.

**[00:47:47]** Q: We talked about the shock
of someone dying close to you

**[00:47:51]** and the sorrow.

**[00:47:52]** I’m not even clear
that the shock is conditioning.

**[00:47:55]** K: Sir, just a minute.

**[00:48:00]** My son dies. Right?
Let’s start from there.

**[00:48:10]** I’m very attached to him.

**[00:48:19]** That attachment is born
out of various causes,

**[00:48:26]** and when he dies
it’s a break from that attachment

**[00:48:33]** – he’s not there
to be attached to.

**[00:48:40]** But I’ve still got the memory
of him and I’m attached to that.

**[00:48:46]** Right?

**[00:48:48]** Physically, I’m not, now he’s gone,
burnt, cremated, whatever you like,

**[00:48:53]** but I have the image of him
to which I’m attached

**[00:49:00]** and I carry that image
for the rest of my life.

**[00:49:07]** Shall we go on from there?

**[00:49:17]** Q: We’ve been talking about
different categories of emotion.

**[00:49:21]** We started with the question,
what do I do with my violence?

**[00:49:27]** K: No, that gentleman
wanted to start

**[00:49:30]** and also Professor Wilkins
wanted to talk about sorrow,

**[00:49:36]** not violence, for the moment.

**[00:49:38]** Q: I thought we were talking
by analogy that the two are emotions

**[00:49:42]** and that the same way of dealing
with them is to stay with them.

**[00:49:45]** K: Not only emotions.

**[00:49:47]** The whole content
of my memory of my son

**[00:49:53]** and all the memories
connected with violence.

**[00:49:58]** Right?

**[00:50:01]** Q: We seem to be talking
about the world of reactions.

**[00:50:07]** K: I don’t want to enter into
reactions, sir, for the moment.

**[00:50:11]** Q: You said that the sorrow was
the image that you have of your son,

**[00:50:15]** the memories,
the wanting him back.

**[00:50:18]** K: I can’t have him back.
But the memory remains.

**[00:50:23]** Q: Yes. I can go with you that far.

**[00:50:30]** K: The memory of my son being dead

**[00:50:36]** causes all kinds
of emotional reactions.

**[00:50:40]** I am attached to this memory.
Right?

**[00:50:45]** That memory is going
to affect me all my life,

**[00:50:51]** which is the beginning
of corruption.

**[00:50:56]** Q: Why?

**[00:50:58]** K: I’m glad.
Somebody asked why.

**[00:51:05]** Q: Do you mean
you’ve become like a computer

**[00:51:07]** which is a fixed program
and cannot change?

**[00:51:09]** K: No, I’m also a computer,
but something else is taking place.

**[00:51:14]** I’m unwilling to learn
that any form of attachment

**[00:51:22]** must inevitably breed
corruption, misery.

**[00:51:28]** You asked, sir, why?
Right?

**[00:51:31]** Q: Perhaps we could redefine
the word ‘corruption’.

**[00:51:35]** K: I mean by ‘corruption’
what the word means.

**[00:51:46]** ‘Rumpere’, to break.

**[00:51:52]** Right?

**[00:51:55]** Can’t somebody pick it from me,
for a minute?

**[00:52:01]** Q: It’s the beginning
of breaking up this attachment.

**[00:52:07]** But it’s not clear
what’s being broken up.

**[00:52:10]** And you’ve rather implied
it’s a good thing to break things up

**[00:52:14]** because apparently we’re enslaved
to so many programs.

**[00:52:17]** K: Let me put it differently.
All right, sir.

**[00:52:22]** You asked why attachment leads
to various forms of disturbance.

**[00:52:32]** Right?

**[00:52:34]** Q: I didn’t actually.
I asked specifically

**[00:52:36]** in the context of the attachment
to sorrow or memory.

**[00:52:40]** That particular example you chose.
K: All right, let’s go into that.

**[00:52:46]** I’ve created the image of my son
and I’m attached to that image.

**[00:52:57]** The image is unreal.

**[00:53:02]** Right?
Q: It’s a real image

**[00:53:06]** and it corresponds to a real son,
who did exist.

**[00:53:09]** K: But it is not actual.

**[00:53:16]** Q: But why not?
If you experience it as an image,

**[00:53:19]** you’re saying
it’s only a real image…

**[00:53:21]** K: I have a memory
of my childhood, if I have,

**[00:53:25]** an image of being
very happy at that time,

**[00:53:30]** and I’m pursuing that image,
that I have been happy,

**[00:53:33]** I’m not now happy
and I hope I’ll be happy.

**[00:53:39]** Q: Is the image saying that?

**[00:53:42]** The image might just be saying I was
happy in my childhood. A memory.

**[00:53:46]** K: Yes.

**[00:53:48]** Q: Does it necessarily imply
anything more than that?

**[00:53:52]** K: Why should I carry that memory?

**[00:53:56]** Why should it continue?

**[00:54:00]** Q: You mean why dwell upon it?

**[00:54:03]** We can’t avoid having memory,
surely?

**[00:54:07]** K: This raises
quite a different problem, sir.

**[00:54:11]** Q: One of the problems with
any image is that it’s incomplete.

**[00:54:17]** If I remember my childhood
as being only very happy,

**[00:54:21]** it’s actually a distortion
of what really took place.

**[00:54:25]** K: Explain to him.

**[00:54:26]** Q: As long as I am operating
on that as a memory,

**[00:54:30]** I’m operating on something
that just wasn’t so.

**[00:54:35]** Q: You may remember
particular happy incidents,

**[00:54:37]** or particularly unhappy incidents.

**[00:54:40]** It seems you can’t avoid
memories of things.

**[00:54:44]** We can avoid dwelling on them
and thinking about it.

**[00:54:49]** K: Would you talk louder, sir,
because we can’t hear.

**[00:54:53]** Q: We can avoid
dwelling on memories, perhaps,

**[00:54:56]** or thinking about them.

**[00:54:57]** We can’t avoid having them.
It’s part of our nature.

**[00:55:00]** K: Part of our nature.

**[00:55:03]** Q: But it’s possible those memories

**[00:55:04]** represent a distortion
of the original

**[00:55:07]** and that they are selective.
Q: Of course. It has to be.

**[00:55:11]** We can’t remember the whole
of our past all the time.

**[00:55:14]** We can only remember bits of it.

**[00:55:18]** So, the attention to memory
is inevitably selective.

**[00:55:21]** And no doubt memory involves
a certain amount of distortion.

**[00:55:25]** But that’s something
we have to live with.

**[00:55:27]** There’s nothing we can do about it.
We can’t chop off memory, surely.

**[00:55:30]** Q: Perhaps there is a suggestion
that memories become burdens.

**[00:55:36]** Q: Presumably memories
can become burdens.

**[00:55:39]** They needn’t do, surely.

**[00:55:41]** Q: But they generally
do become burdens.

**[00:55:45]** Q: Do they? There are several
kinds of memories, surely.

**[00:55:48]** All our experience with which
we react, is based on memory.

**[00:55:54]** All the skills we have,

**[00:55:56]** like riding bicycles and
playing pianos, doing mathematics,

**[00:56:00]** useful skills based on training,
conditioning and memory.

**[00:56:03]** Q: But those are factual memories.

**[00:56:07]** When I learn how to add,
it’s a factual memory.

**[00:56:10]** But when I think
about a hurtful thing

**[00:56:14]** that happened to me twenty years ago

**[00:56:17]** and I’m carrying it all my life,
then I’m carrying a burden.

**[00:56:22]** Q: The specific thing being talked
about was an image of a person.

**[00:56:28]** If I have an image of myself

**[00:56:31]** and I think I am that
or my son was that,

**[00:56:35]** it’s probably a distortion
of the reality.

**[00:56:40]** The person was probably
much more complex.

**[00:56:43]** One would chose to remember only
the nice or convenient parts.

**[00:56:48]** Q: The answer might be
to have a better memory.

**[00:56:51]** K: Louder, sir.

**[00:56:53]** Q: Whether the memory
is pleasant or unpleasant,

**[00:56:56]** isn’t one an acting out
of an unreality, which is an image?

**[00:57:03]** The son is dead, the happy
or unhappy childhood is gone,

**[00:57:08]** yet it continues to generate
a psychological action within us

**[00:57:13]** or in our actual actions,

**[00:57:15]** which is based on a phantom,

**[00:57:19]** an idea and not a fact,
at that moment.

**[00:57:23]** Q: I find it difficult
to grasp the idea of facts.

**[00:57:28]** The idea that the real world
is really there

**[00:57:31]** and only things
that are really there

**[00:57:32]** are things present to your senses,

**[00:57:35]** whereas an image or a memory
is not real.

**[00:57:37]** It seems to be
a strange distinction.

**[00:57:40]** Q: They have their own reality,
obviously.

**[00:57:43]** If I thought I was Napoleon
that would be a fact for me,

**[00:57:49]** but it would still be a phantom.

**[00:57:54]** Q: But a memory of what you did,
is not a phantom.

**[00:57:59]** To call it a phantom
doesn’t add or subtract

**[00:58:01]** from the fact it’s a memory.

**[00:58:03]** Q: Could I possibly
have a go at this one?

**[00:58:08]** It seems to me that
images and memories

**[00:58:14]** are very important, useful,

**[00:58:17]** and in fact essential to us
being human beings.

**[00:58:22]** But the trouble is that
they tend to be over-obtrusive

**[00:58:31]** and block our capacity
for open seeing in the present.

**[00:58:38]** K: That’s all, sir, quite right.

**[00:58:41]** Q: They are conditioning you,
psychological memories.

**[00:58:45]** If I’m meeting you
for the first time,

**[00:58:47]** I’ve never met you before,

**[00:58:48]** you’re in a hurry
and you’re rude to me,

**[00:58:51]** I would have that memory
next time of meeting you.

**[00:58:56]** I would have a distance
because you were rude to me.

**[00:59:00]** But when I’m running in the forest,
standing over a tree or branch,

**[00:59:05]** the next day I see that tree,
I don’t have a bad memory of it.

**[00:59:09]** I don’t know why there’s such
a difference between those memories.

**[00:59:21]** Q: I’d like to suggest

**[00:59:23]** that computers help us
to understand what memory is.

**[00:59:28]** A computer has have to have
a view of the outside world.

**[00:59:33]** K: I think Dr Wilkins
has made it very clear.

**[00:59:40]** Q: This whole question is
that we’re here now, physically,

**[00:59:47]** and we’re not totally
with the potential of this moment

**[00:59:52]** because we’re all still locked
in various memories, in the past.

**[01:00:03]** Presumably,
that’s the corruption.

**[01:00:06]** Q: If your brain is occupied

**[01:00:08]** with the burden of memories
all the time...

**[01:00:13]** K: Louder, please.

**[01:00:16]** Q: If your brain is occupied with
the burden of memories and hurts,

**[01:00:23]** it hasn’t got energy to be present,
it’s not empty to explore potential.

**[01:00:37]** K: Would you say, sir,
the whole of me is memory?

**[01:00:47]** Q: I don’t think
I’d go that far, no.

**[01:00:50]** K: Just a minute.
Why not?

**[01:00:59]** Q: There’s a certain structure
to the way we order our memories

**[01:01:03]** which is not contained within
the memories of specific events.

**[01:01:07]** Nor can it be made simply
out of the composite of past events.

**[01:01:11]** There’s a certain structure
to thought and experience

**[01:01:14]** which exists before specific
memories of specific events.

**[01:01:19]** K: If I am a carpenter,
I have that memory.

**[01:01:26]** If I’m married I’ve all the memories
of my relation with my wife.

**[01:01:32]** If I’m – what? – with my son,
I have all those memories.

**[01:01:40]** And the memories of my father,
the memories of my country,

**[01:01:47]** the tradition of the country,
aspirations, hurts, arrogance

**[01:01:58]** – all that vast
quantity of memory is me.

**[01:02:04]** So I am memory.

**[01:02:06]** Q: But not only memory.
K: Wait, wait.

**[01:02:09]** K: I won’t say, ‘Not only’.
I only know I am memory.

**[01:02:16]** The tradition, the religion,
the superstition, the illusions,

**[01:02:21]** I am a Brahmin, I am nobody,
I won’t touch anybody,

**[01:02:24]** I’ve inherited those
tremendous memories.

**[01:02:30]** I’m all that.

**[01:02:31]** So, then you’re saying there’s also
a memory I’m not all that.

**[01:02:40]** Q: I don’t think it’s a memory,

**[01:02:43]** I think it’s a present sense
that one’s not all that.

**[01:02:46]** K: That may be also illusion.
Q: It may be, it may not be.

**[01:02:50]** K: I’m not criticising.
We’re just examining.

**[01:02:53]** Q: Yes, so am I.

**[01:02:55]** K: So, my illusion is my memory.

**[01:03:03]** Q: Is it?
K: Isn’t it?

**[01:03:08]** Q: I don’t see which illusion
you’re thinking about now.

**[01:03:12]** Are you saying that
the illusion that I exist now,

**[01:03:15]** I have access to memories,
I am conditioned by memories,

**[01:03:18]** and yet there’s a sense of existing
here and now in the present,

**[01:03:23]** which isn’t itself a memory.

**[01:03:27]** K: Sir, I’ve been told
from childhood

**[01:03:31]** there is something in me
which is totally different

**[01:03:34]** from all things outside me.

**[01:03:38]** That’s part of my memory.

**[01:03:42]** There is memory
that there is God in me

**[01:03:48]** – etc., etc.

**[01:03:49]** That’s also a memory.

**[01:03:53]** So, from what I have observed,
I’m an entire structure of memory,

**[01:04:01]** even though I say there is something
in me which is totally different.

**[01:04:08]** I carry this memory
all along my life.

**[01:04:12]** As Dr Wilkins pointed out,
it’s a tremendous burden.

**[01:04:20]** There’s no freedom in that.

**[01:04:29]** Q: Is it not true that this store
of memories is only a burden,

**[01:04:38]** if you allow them to interrupt
your further development

**[01:04:41]** and your further progress
and understanding?

**[01:04:45]** K: All that memory
is my image of myself.

**[01:04:51]** Q: But your statement…
Q: You’re still thinking.

**[01:04:59]** Q: Your statement when you said,
‘All I know is memory’.

**[01:05:03]** K: And the image
that memory has created.

**[01:05:07]** I am that memory.
Q: That stops me in my tracks.

**[01:05:10]** I don’t know
where to go from there.

**[01:05:12]** K: Wait!
Don’t go anywhere from there.

**[01:05:16]** You want to go somewhere.
I don’t.

**[01:05:21]** I say I’m all memory. I’m looking
at the extraordinary fact.

**[01:05:27]** Q: Do you mean that the ‘I’,
the ‘me’, the centre

**[01:05:30]** that’s watching the memory
is memory too?

**[01:05:32]** K: Of course.

**[01:05:38]** I don’t want to go away beyond
this extraordinary revelation to me,

**[01:05:47]** to realise,
‘My God, I’m all memory!’

**[01:05:52]** The image about myself
as being somebody,

**[01:05:56]** is still an image, a memory.

**[01:06:01]** So I say, ‘All right, let’s look’.

**[01:06:05]** Am I looking at it
as an outsider looking in?

**[01:06:13]** You follow what I mean?
Or, I am that.

**[01:06:18]** The observer is that.

**[01:06:22]** The observer is the observed
in this case.

**[01:06:34]** So, I see the fact

**[01:06:38]** – it may be illusory,
I’m subject to correction –

**[01:06:42]** but I say, ‘I am all that’.
I won’t move from there.

**[01:06:48]** Because if I move,
it’ll be another memory.

**[01:06:59]** We’re all saying to ourselves,
‘What shall I do next?’

**[01:07:05]** I don’t want to do anything next.

**[01:07:08]** If I do, it’ll still be
born out of memory

**[01:07:12]** and the action
will be part of memory

**[01:07:14]** and back again to the same cycle.

**[01:07:18]** Q: That is the burden of sorrow.

**[01:07:21]** K: No, just a minute.
That is what I am.

**[01:07:29]** I’ve learnt mathematics, biology,
I’ve learnt science,

**[01:07:32]** I’ve learnt a dozen things.

**[01:07:37]** All that learning is memory.

**[01:07:41]** Q: But in place of that there is
the freezing of the learning.

**[01:07:50]** We freeze the moment.
K: I am nothing but that.

**[01:07:56]** I am the observer, the observed.
I am all that.

**[01:08:02]** That’s what I mean.

**[01:08:04]** If I can stay with it
and see what happens.

**[01:08:07]** We don’t.

**[01:08:13]** What happens when I realise

**[01:08:15]** that the division between
the observer and the observed

**[01:08:19]** is illusory?

**[01:08:22]** All movement stops.

**[01:08:28]** What do you say, sir?

**[01:08:31]** Q: Well, I’m wrestling
with the idea.

**[01:08:36]** The sense that one is more than that

**[01:08:39]** comes from feeling that one has
choice and the capacity to act.

**[01:08:43]** The feeling that one has the choice
to act in different ways

**[01:08:48]** gives one the idea that there’s a
doer, not just a conditioned memory,

**[01:08:51]** which can chose
and select among memories,

**[01:08:54]** and that there is a centre
which is more than memory.

**[01:08:56]** Now, you’ll tell me that
the centre that says it’s doing

**[01:09:01]** is in fact only a memory itself.
K: Yes, sir.

**[01:09:03]** Q: I don’t know if I accept that.
K: Don’t accept it.

**[01:09:06]** Don’t let’s accept it.
Q: You might be able to prove it

**[01:09:08]** but, intellectually,
that’s not how it feels.

**[01:09:14]** K: It may be my conditioning
to say I’m not that.

**[01:09:18]** Q: And it may not be that.

**[01:09:21]** We may have a direct intuition
in how it really is

**[01:09:24]** which is not
a matter of conditioning.

**[01:09:33]** Q: I’m worried by the fact
that we’re all sitting here

**[01:09:35]** listening to what you’re saying
and thinking about it.

**[01:09:39]** K: That’s right, sir.

**[01:09:46]** You have hit the nail on the head.

**[01:09:50]** Q: You started to tell us how it was
that sorrow led to corruption

**[01:09:55]** and we’ve diverted to talking
about memories and images.

**[01:09:59]** K: Sir, corruption is the image.

**[01:10:10]** The question is,
is there an end to sorrow?

**[01:10:16]** Man has suffered for a million years
and we’re still suffering.

**[01:10:25]** Q: And you’re saying
that insight is the end to sorrow

**[01:10:27]** and insight has
nothing to do with memory.

**[01:10:37]** Q: But how is this insight possible
if we’re nothing but memory?

**[01:10:43]** K: To stop moving from that fact.

**[01:10:49]** Q: That means we fully
have to understand that…

**[01:10:51]** K: No, there is
nothing to understand.

**[01:10:56]** There is nothing to understand.
There is no action.

**[01:11:01]** Non-action is positive action.

**[01:11:06]** Q: But if somebody is pointing out
to me that all I am is memories

**[01:11:10]** and I’ve never heard that before,
that suggestion…

**[01:11:14]** K: How do you listen to that?
Just take that, for a minute.

**[01:11:20]** It may be a silly statement,
it may be true.

**[01:11:24]** How do you listen to it?

**[01:11:29]** Are you listening or arguing?

**[01:11:41]** Q: One thinks about it.
K: Therefore you’re not listening.

**[01:11:48]** I’m telling you – not you –
I’m telling someone, ‘I love you’.

**[01:11:55]** You don’t say,
‘I’ll think about it’.

**[01:12:01]** I love you.

**[01:12:05]** You might say,
‘Why do you love me?’

**[01:12:10]** I don’t know, I just love you.
I have no cause.

**[01:12:13]** I don’t want anything from you
– your body, sex, money, nothing –

**[01:12:18]** I don’t want anything,
I just love you.

**[01:12:25]** Q: But it seems that instead
of the mind stopping, it goes…

**[01:12:31]** K: Please, if I come to you
and tell you I love you,

**[01:12:34]** do you think about it?

**[01:12:40]** You throw a brick at me and say,
‘I’m married already’.

**[01:12:46]** Q: A better analogy would be if you
came to me and said you loved me.

**[01:12:50]** Because you said you are all memory.

**[01:12:52]** If you say you love me,
I actually would think about that.

**[01:12:56]** I would think,
‘Is it true? What does it mean?’

**[01:13:00]** If you said, ‘I love you’,
that’s different.

**[01:13:03]** K: That’s all I’m saying.

**[01:13:05]** It has no cause.
Memory has a cause.

**[01:13:31]** Love is not a memory.

**[01:13:34]** Q: No.
K: Exactly, sir.

**[01:13:38]** It’s not desire.
It’s not pleasure.

**[01:13:44]** So, as it has no cause,
it’s enormous.

**[01:13:52]** Memory says, ‘What do you mean?
Tell me all about it’

**[01:13:55]** – you follow? –
‘Let’s wallow in it’.

**[01:14:02]** Q: Well, I don’t know.

**[01:14:06]** After hearing that everything we do
is an illusion and conditioned,

**[01:14:13]** I might begin to think,

**[01:14:15]** ‘Maybe love’s just
a matter of conditioning’

**[01:14:17]** – we’ve seen all these films
and read about it.

**[01:14:20]** K: Quite, quite.
Q: I could easily doubt that.

**[01:14:25]** You might tell me that it’s just…

**[01:14:27]** I’d be inclined to think
that love is something that exists.

**[01:14:32]** Now I’m beginning to think,

**[01:14:33]** ‘Maybe that’s memory too,
we’re conditioned,

**[01:14:36]** our terrible educational process...’
K: Sir, sir, wait.

**[01:14:40]** I come to you
and say, ‘I love you’.

**[01:14:47]** Do you think about it?

**[01:14:53]** Q: I might wonder what you meant.
K: I’ll tell you what I mean.

**[01:14:59]** I love you. I don’t want your money,
I don’t want a thing from you,

**[01:15:07]** and I mean it.

**[01:15:11]** Q: Then I would accept that
gratefully, as a fact.

**[01:15:19]** K: You accept it.

**[01:15:22]** Then you don’t think about it.

**[01:15:25]** Q: But with this other thing,
that all I am is memories…

**[01:15:29]** K: Wait. I’ll come back to that.

**[01:15:34]** I say, ‘I love you’.

**[01:15:38]** Q: But I might wonder why.

**[01:15:46]** K: I have stated it,
I don’t want a thing from you.

**[01:15:50]** Q: Period.

**[01:15:54]** I could accept
that this is a fact,

**[01:15:57]** I might still think,
‘What is this love…?’

**[01:16:03]** K: I go into it with you.

**[01:16:07]** I say it has absolutely
nothing to do with desire,

**[01:16:16]** or with pleasure.

**[01:16:19]** I’m not even attached to you.
I love you.

**[01:16:27]** Q: But there is only love
when there is no return to me.

**[01:16:38]** K: When I say, ‘I love you’,
it means I love.

**[01:16:41]** It’s not ‘I’ love ‘you’ –
don’t mix up the word ‘I’ and ‘you’.

**[01:16:49]** Q: There seems to be something
very simple at the end of it,

**[01:16:55]** but again,
there’s an irresistible…

**[01:16:58]** K: You see…

**[01:17:03]** We’re all so very clever,
that’s what it is.

**[01:17:09]** A man comes to me
and says, ‘I love you’.

**[01:17:14]** What an extraordinary thing,
‘I don’t want a thing from you’!

**[01:17:20]** Q: It doesn’t seem to be very
meaningful, if he just says that.

**[01:17:24]** K: Sir, I mean it.
I don’t want a thing from you.

**[01:17:30]** Q: If you say to someone,
‘I love you’,

**[01:17:32]** you’re expecting a form of response.

**[01:17:37]** Unless you say it in the same way

**[01:17:40]** as you would say to anyone,
‘I love you,’

**[01:17:41]** in that you love everybody, perhaps.

**[01:17:43]** But if you say it to an individual,

**[01:17:46]** there must be
some particular reason.

**[01:17:49]** K: So, you attach reason to love.

**[01:17:55]** Q: No, one could say
that one can accept love

**[01:17:59]** as something which is not
necessarily part of memory.

**[01:18:02]** There might be a reason
for saying it.

**[01:18:06]** You might love somebody. You might
not feel any reason to say it.

**[01:18:11]** But if they seem
disturbed and worried,

**[01:18:13]** you might think it would
help them actually to say it,

**[01:18:16]** so you might have
a reason for saying it.

**[01:18:18]** There may not be a reason for loving
them. It may just be a fact.

**[01:18:22]** K: Yes, sir,
I understand all that.

**[01:18:26]** Q: If love is not memory,
what is love?

**[01:18:31]** Where does it come from?

**[01:18:36]** You’re saying we’re all memory.

**[01:18:39]** K: Love has
nothing to do with memory.

**[01:18:45]** Of course, if it has,
what does it mean?

**[01:18:49]** Desire, pleasure, fear, attachment –

**[01:18:53]** all that we generally
accept as love.

**[01:18:59]** Q: It seems to me that we are
talking about memory all the time.

**[01:19:03]** It seems that one hundred percent…

**[01:19:05]** K: You see, sir…
That’s right, sir.

**[01:19:09]** I beg your pardon,
I was talking to myself.

**[01:19:14]** Q: A hundred percent of our time
is memory. But it is not so to me.

**[01:19:21]** The small fractions of time when we
realise a problem, or have an idea,

**[01:19:27]** in that very minute moment,
it seems not to be a memory.

**[01:19:32]** Is it?
I don’t know.

**[01:19:36]** Q: But we all seem to deal with
this general structure of memory,

**[01:19:40]** so making it complicated.

**[01:19:42]** Somebody says something simple
and we want to complicate it

**[01:19:48]** most of the time.

**[01:19:50]** It appears to work like that.

**[01:19:58]** Q: You were asking us…
K: No, I’m not asking anything.

**[01:20:03]** Q: You were saying when something
is said like, ‘I love you’,

**[01:20:10]** do you just listen to it?
And you talked about sorrow.

**[01:20:14]** Can you just…?

**[01:20:16]** K: Look, Scott, just a minute.
I’ve known you for some years.

**[01:20:22]** We’ve talked considerably.

**[01:20:25]** And one morning,
when you are in my room,

**[01:20:29]** I say, ‘Scott, I love you’.

**[01:20:34]** What happens to you?

**[01:20:42]** What actually happens to you,
when I say that to you?

**[01:20:49]** Do you say, ‘Let me think’?
Q: No.

**[01:20:51]** K: Or, ‘Why do you love me?’
Q: First, there’s just a listening.

**[01:20:54]** K: What happens to you when a man
comes to you and says, ‘I love you’,

**[01:20:59]** and says,
‘I don’t want a thing from you’?

**[01:21:06]** Q: Well, it’s very humbling.

**[01:21:10]** One listens and one hears it,
one reacts, however one reacts.

**[01:21:17]** K: How do you react?
Q: One takes it in.

**[01:21:22]** K: What does that mean?

**[01:21:24]** K: Wait a minute,
what does that mean?

**[01:21:27]** Q: Like an arrow.
It gets warm, burning.

**[01:21:35]** Q: Don’t you have a feeling
when somebody tells you that?

**[01:21:42]** Q: One will be pleased.

**[01:21:46]** Q: I’d say, ‘Thank you’.

**[01:21:49]** K: Is that all?

**[01:21:51]** Q: ‘I love you, too’.

**[01:21:54]** That’s a normal response,
if there is a mutual feeling.

**[01:21:59]** Q: It’s quite a shock, isn’t it?

**[01:22:01]** Usually when somebody says that,
implied is that they want something.

**[01:22:07]** Usually when you say that
you want something in return.

**[01:22:12]** K: So, are you all thinking
in terms of something to return?

**[01:22:20]** Q: I would be nonplussed.
I would feel quite nonplussed.

**[01:22:27]** K: Has anybody come and told you
that they love you?

**[01:22:38]** Q: Krishnaji, in trying to listen
to what you’ve been saying,

**[01:22:44]** I had an insight
into this whole dialogue now.

**[01:22:51]** There’s just an understanding
in silence. Nothing more.

**[01:22:58]** There’s nothing more to it.
There’s an understanding in silence

**[01:23:03]** when there is a listening
without thinking.

**[01:23:13]** Q: There’s a feeling of oneness.

**[01:23:20]** K: So, what place
has memory in love?

**[01:23:29]** Q: It depends what kind of love
you’re talking about

**[01:23:33]** and in what language you consider
the meaning of the word ‘love’.

**[01:23:37]** K: I’m speaking English.

**[01:23:40]** Q: In English, you love coffee,
the garden, your wife.

**[01:23:44]** K: I love coffee, I love my ground,
I love my wife, my job.

**[01:23:52]** We’re not talking of that,
are we?

**[01:23:55]** Q: There may be some connection
between love and memory,

**[01:23:58]** an implicit connection.
There must be.

**[01:24:01]** Because I mean,
you tell me you love me...

**[01:24:05]** K: What an extraordinary audience
this is!

**[01:24:11]** Q: But if I love you and I don’t
want you to fall over something,

**[01:24:14]** I act on you.
I say, ‘Don’t go there’.

**[01:24:18]** K: Yes.

**[01:24:19]** Q: There must be some connection.
I remember that that’s dangerous.

**[01:24:27]** K: If somebody said, ‘I love you.
I don’t want a thing from you’,

**[01:24:39]** it has done something
tremendous to me.

**[01:24:45]** Nobody has said that to me before.

**[01:24:49]** They always wanted
something out of it,

**[01:24:56]** either my body or sex or money
– they wanted something.

**[01:25:02]** Here you come and tell me,

**[01:25:05]** ‘Look, I love you
but I don’t want a thing from you’.

**[01:25:09]** What a tremendous thing.

**[01:25:10]** You understand
what it’ll do to me?

**[01:25:18]** So, what relationship
has that love to memory?

**[01:25:27]** If you say, ‘I’ll think about it’,
then you are back.

**[01:25:33]** Q: So, it has no relationship,
if that is the case.

**[01:25:42]** Q: It’s based on the conception
of the ‘you’ that is loved,

**[01:25:46]** which is a construction
put together by memory, experience,

**[01:25:52]** by evaluation of qualities,

**[01:25:57]** perceiving that person
as a unique individual,

**[01:26:01]** and therefore, discriminating
qualities and virtues in him.

**[01:26:06]** Q: There’s a commonalty
of consciousness.

**[01:26:09]** K: Also, love has no choice.
I mustn’t go into all that.

**[01:26:22]** If you say, ‘How will it act?
You say, ‘I love you’.

**[01:26:29]** All right, Old Boy.
What do you do about it?’

**[01:26:33]** Right?
Right, sir?

**[01:26:37]** I can’t answer. I don’t know. I just
love you. I’ll see what happens.

**[01:26:41]** But if you say,
‘What will you do when you love me?’

**[01:26:47]** then what is your reply?

**[01:26:52]** Obvious.
‘Give me something’.

**[01:27:07]** Q: If you say that it would
give one a strong feeling

**[01:27:14]** for the universal
consciousness of humanity,

**[01:27:18]** I think this is the kind of effect
it would have on me.

**[01:27:27]** Q: You really disappear
and become the other.

**[01:27:32]** K: I don’t know.
That’s a theory.

**[01:27:35]** Q: No it’s not a theory.
K: Maybe.

**[01:27:39]** Q: Krishnaji,
the atmosphere in this room,

**[01:27:44]** there is a basis of love here,

**[01:27:47]** and we are not falling apart
or ripping each other.

**[01:27:51]** It is just a feeling here.
K: That’s not important.

**[01:28:00]** Where are we now?

**[01:28:02]** Q: Sir, what happens if there’s
no you to tell me that you love me?

**[01:28:18]** K: If I tell you what happens to me,
if somebody came and told me this,

**[01:28:26]** I can’t tell you what happens.

**[01:28:28]** You will say, ‘Let me capture it.
Is this right?’

**[01:28:31]** We’re off into something terrible.

**[01:28:36]** Q: What happens when there is
no-one, when one is by oneself?

**[01:28:44]** K: That is, has love to be told
to somebody, ‘I love you’?

**[01:28:50]** Q: Yes, that is the question.
K: I’m saying that, sir.

**[01:28:58]** Suppose you have loved…

**[01:29:00]** I won’t discuss it any more,
it’s too silly.

**[01:29:07]** Q: Before we get too far,

**[01:29:11]** I’d like to pose
an obvious question here,

**[01:29:15]** since the topic has been the topic
of education for the last two days.

**[01:29:21]** If we had to create
an educational environment,

**[01:29:25]** would we include
in the content of that education

**[01:29:29]** all this that we’ve been discussing?
K: Yes, sir.

**[01:29:34]** How am I going to convey all that
we have discussed so far to my son.

**[01:29:40]** I am an educator – how am I
going to convey all this to him?

**[01:29:46]** He comes to the school
already conditioned.

**[01:29:52]** He’s already using terrible words,
violent.

**[01:29:56]** He’s like the rest of us.

**[01:30:00]** So, what am I to do?
What’s my relationship to him?

**[01:30:07]** Am I also like him
or like the rest?

**[01:30:13]** Or I have seen something
which I want to transmit to him.

**[01:30:19]** Will he listen?
Will he play the game with me?

**[01:30:26]** Q: Will that transmission mode
be the same as this one?

**[01:30:32]** Or one to one?
K: Maybe, it all depends.

**[01:30:39]** If you feel very strongly
about something,

**[01:30:44]** that feeling of vitality,

**[01:30:49]** that intense feeling
is communicated.

**[01:30:52]** But if you’re merely intellectually
discussing what education is...

**[01:31:02]** Q: And it doesn’t have to be
just a verbal communication.

**[01:31:09]** K: What is non-verbal communication?

**[01:31:13]** Thought transference?

**[01:31:15]** Q: Actually living it.
K: Yes, sir.

**[01:31:18]** If I don’t live what I am
talking about, what value has it?

**[01:31:22]** What is the point
of talking about it?

**[01:31:26]** Q: It becomes theory.
K: Then, there is a feeling.

**[01:31:37]** Suppose I’m absolutely, irrevocably
non-nationalist, non-tribal,

**[01:31:49]** and my student is full of that.
Right?

**[01:31:53]** What’s my relationship to him?

**[01:31:59]** He wants to be completely British
or French or some other rot.

**[01:32:05]** He wants to be completely that
and I am totally opposed to that.

**[01:32:09]** What happens?

**[01:32:17]** Q: At first, there is conflict.
K: No.

**[01:32:26]** I’m immovable
but he is movable. Sorry!

**[01:32:33]** Q: That doesn’t create conflict?

**[01:32:38]** K: What do you say?
Please, let’s discuss it.

**[01:32:40]** Q: It creates conflict in me
because I may have a feeling

**[01:32:44]** for what you’re saying
and I want to get there.

**[01:32:53]** Q: First of all, I’d show him

**[01:32:55]** the destruction
nationalism has caused.

**[01:33:02]** Q: It’s something
more than that, isn’t it?

**[01:33:07]** Q: You’ve got to show him
that you understand

**[01:33:10]** why he takes this attitude.

**[01:33:12]** K: Of course,
I go into all that.

**[01:33:14]** But I stand – you follow? –
I’m immovable, but he is movable.

**[01:33:24]** Q: What if he is immovable, also?
K: Then we are together.

**[01:33:30]** Q: But it’s not for me
to move him.

**[01:33:35]** K: No.

**[01:33:39]** Q: You mean you’re not strengthening
his conditioning anymore

**[01:33:43]** because you’re immovable.
K: No, sir.

**[01:33:48]** Say, for instance,
you are free from conditioning

**[01:33:53]** and I come to you as your student,
full of conditioning.

**[01:33:58]** To you, it is absolute,
burning reality.

**[01:34:04]** And I face you,
I begin to criticise you.

**[01:34:09]** I say, ‘What nonsense’.

**[01:34:13]** But you explain to me, step
by step, the rationality of war,

**[01:34:19]** the creation of war and nationalism,

**[01:34:24]** and if I’m at all intelligent,
I absorb what you’re saying.

**[01:34:29]** You’re not talking to me
only at a conscious level

**[01:34:33]** but also at the deeper levels.

**[01:34:41]** Q: Yes, in sharing a perception
of something that one sees as true

**[01:34:49]** is there a lot of this sharing
or communicating that goes on

**[01:34:53]** despite the words or subject?
K: Obviously. Must.

**[01:34:56]** Q: If one is looking at something.

**[01:35:11]** K: It’s one o’clock.
We’d better stop.

**[01:35:16]** We meet tomorrow morning,
don’t we? Isn’t it at eleven?

**[01:35:21]** Q: Half-past eleven.

**[01:35:28]** K: Is it all right?
