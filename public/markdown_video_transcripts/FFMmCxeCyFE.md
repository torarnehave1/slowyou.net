**[00:00:33]** Krishnamurti:
I didn’t expect so many people.

**[00:01:01]** I wonder
what we shall talk about.

**[00:01:25]** It seems to me

**[00:01:30]** that our self-centred problems

**[00:01:37]** and the problems that lie
beyond our own personal crises,

**[00:01:47]** disturbances and miseries,

**[00:01:51]** the world about us is more or less
in chaos, in great confusion.

**[00:02:00]** I think everybody will admit that

**[00:02:03]** without a great deal of trouble,
with a great deal of investigation.

**[00:02:09]** And nobody apparently
sees a solution for this,

**[00:02:15]** neither politically,
nor religiously, nor economically.

**[00:02:24]** That again is an obvious fact.

**[00:02:29]** And nobody asks
if there is a way out of all this,

**[00:02:39]** the trap in which human beings
have been caught for millennia,

**[00:02:47]** if there is any way out of this
mess, confusion, turmoil, terror.

**[00:03:00]** Not finding an answer,

**[00:03:05]** many people resort
to the old traditions,

**[00:03:13]** join old religions,
or form a small community

**[00:03:21]** hoping thereby to solve
their own particular problems.

**[00:03:31]** And I may suggest
that there is a way out of all this,

**[00:03:41]** out of our present continuous
misery, conflict, strife,

**[00:03:51]** various forms of terror

**[00:03:57]** and the threatening wars,

**[00:04:04]** not only near but far.

**[00:04:10]** So to investigate all this

**[00:04:16]** and find out if there is
a solution, a way out,

**[00:04:22]** without suppression, without escape,

**[00:04:28]** without any kind of illusion.

**[00:04:35]** And if you will have
the patience, energy

**[00:04:47]** and the serious responsibility
that is involved,

**[00:04:53]** we can think together.

**[00:05:04]** I hope you are prepared for that
– thinking together.

**[00:05:13]** There are two different
kinds of thinking:

**[00:05:17]** one, thinking about something –

**[00:05:20]** about a problem,
about a personal issue,

**[00:05:27]** or about the world,
and so on.

**[00:05:33]** That is, thinking about something.

**[00:05:41]** And is there
another kind of thinking

**[00:05:46]** which is not about something?

**[00:05:53]** Please, carefully,
I will go into this

**[00:06:01]** widely and deeply if I may.

**[00:06:05]** So we are asking:

**[00:06:08]** our minds are accustomed
to think about something

**[00:06:14]** – about a problem,
out of our personal desires,

**[00:06:22]** fulfilments, sorrow, anxiety,
and so on – about something.

**[00:06:32]** And we are accustomed to that,
‘thinking about’.

**[00:06:41]** We are asking, not about something
but thinking itself.

**[00:06:57]** If this issue is clear,

**[00:07:02]** not about something
which will come later on,

**[00:07:06]** but thinking together.

**[00:07:15]** Please, see the difference:

**[00:07:18]** thinking together does not mean
that you agree or disagree,

**[00:07:24]** accept or reject,
defend or offend,

**[00:07:30]** but together find out

**[00:07:38]** if it is possible

**[00:07:43]** by thinking together
we can act together,

**[00:07:54]** not about something

**[00:07:59]** – please, apply your minds
to this a little bit –

**[00:08:02]** not about something,
which we can more or less do.

**[00:08:08]** We can agree
to act in a certain way,

**[00:08:13]** we can put our minds together

**[00:08:20]** to investigate a certain problem,

**[00:08:25]** but we are not going into that
for the present.

**[00:08:31]** But we are asking:

**[00:08:34]** thinking together
without any barriers,

**[00:08:42]** without any inhibitions,
without any prejudice,

**[00:08:49]** letting go your
personal experiences,

**[00:08:55]** your personal urge to fulfil.

**[00:09:03]** Which means you and the speaker,
together,

**[00:09:11]** be free to think.

**[00:09:18]** Is this somewhat clear?

**[00:09:24]** Please, this needs
a great deal of investigation

**[00:09:30]** because we are
conditioned

**[00:09:34]** to think together
about certain ideas,

**[00:09:41]** about certain conclusions,

**[00:09:45]** philosophical, historical,
and so on.

**[00:09:51]** Then there are those who agree,
and those who disagree.

**[00:09:58]** They form two camps,

**[00:10:02]** each opposing the other,

**[00:10:09]** which is what is
happening in the world.

**[00:10:13]** The Totalitarian,
the so-called Democratic,

**[00:10:18]** the Capitalists and the Marxists,
and so on,

**[00:10:24]** agreeing and disagreeing,
opposing and defending.

**[00:10:34]** Whereas we are asking,

**[00:10:37]** if we could think together
freely,

**[00:10:46]** you letting go all your experiences,

**[00:10:53]** your conclusions, your desires,
prejudices, and so on,

**[00:11:01]** putting them aside,

**[00:11:05]** so that together we can think.

**[00:11:18]** Will you do that?

**[00:11:23]** You and the speaker
putting aside his beliefs,

**[00:11:33]** his opinions and judgements
and evaluations,

**[00:11:38]** his hopes, and so on,

**[00:11:41]** and together think,

**[00:11:45]** not about something,
but think.

**[00:11:52]** Shall we do it?

**[00:11:58]** Which means

**[00:12:01]** that being free
of our own personal problems,

**[00:12:11]** urges, demands,
fulfilments, and so on,

**[00:12:20]** being free to investigate together,

**[00:12:31]** not investigate into something,

**[00:12:36]** but the capacity,
the spirit of investigation.

**[00:12:47]** Is this somewhat clear?

**[00:12:58]** Which requires
not only that you listen,

**[00:13:10]** not to what is being said,

**[00:13:14]** but to listen to the quality
of a mind that is thinking,

**[00:13:25]** not with regard to something,

**[00:13:31]** but listening to the whole
quality of thinking,

**[00:13:45]** which requires certain
awareness and attention.

**[00:13:55]** Right?

**[00:13:58]** Where there is attention

**[00:14:01]** there is no centre
from which you are attending.

**[00:14:12]** I wonder if you are doing it
as we are talking.

**[00:14:18]** That is, when you attend,

**[00:14:26]** in which there is no division,

**[00:14:35]** then in that attention

**[00:14:42]** thought is not
your thought or my thought,

**[00:14:48]** it is thinking.

**[00:14:55]** Can we proceed
along these lines?

**[00:15:00]** Are we following each other?

**[00:15:08]** When you give your attention,

**[00:15:12]** which means

**[00:15:25]** to give all your mind,
your heart, your nerves,

**[00:15:29]** to completely give attention,

**[00:15:35]** do you find that there is a centre
from which you are attending?

**[00:15:44]** So in that attention,

**[00:15:46]** there is not your thinking
and the speaker thinking,

**[00:15:53]** there is only a quality
of total attention.

**[00:15:59]** Right?

**[00:16:01]** Don’t look so mystified,

**[00:16:07]** it is really quite simple.

**[00:16:22]** You see,

**[00:16:25]** our thinking,
ordinary everyday thinking,

**[00:16:31]** is with regard
to a certain subject,

**[00:16:36]** to a certain action,
to a certain problem

**[00:16:40]** – thinking about something.
Right?

**[00:16:44]** Right?

**[00:16:47]** That thinking is from an experience,

**[00:16:54]** from a memory,
from a knowledge,

**[00:17:00]** therefore it is your experience
opposed to another’s experience.

**[00:17:08]** So there is always division.

**[00:17:13]** Right?

**[00:17:16]** Please, follow this.

**[00:17:21]** You have your opinion
and another has his opinion,

**[00:17:27]** and the two divisive opinions,
dividing opinions

**[00:17:32]** can never come together.

**[00:17:36]** If you believe in something

**[00:17:39]** and another believes
in something else strongly,

**[00:17:45]** then there is wide cleavage.

**[00:17:53]** To that way of thinking
we are accustomed.

**[00:17:57]** Right?

**[00:18:03]** Now we are asking:

**[00:18:06]** that thinking can
never be ‘together’

**[00:18:12]** because it is always either
opposing, defending or accepting.

**[00:18:20]** Whereas we are saying
something entirely different.

**[00:18:26]** Thinking together implies

**[00:18:30]** that you and the other have let go
all their prejudices, and all that

**[00:18:37]** – thinking together –

**[00:18:43]** because in that thinking together

**[00:18:48]** there is no your thinking
and my thinking separate,

**[00:18:55]** it is together thinking.

**[00:18:59]** Right?

**[00:19:01]** Have you understood this?

**[00:19:03]** No, please, this is very serious

**[00:19:04]** because it is either you accept it
as an intellectual concept,

**[00:19:13]** which then becomes
your concept and his concept.

**[00:19:22]** If you merely accept
the verbal explanation

**[00:19:28]** and draw from that explanation
a conclusion

**[00:19:32]** according to your experience,
knowledge, prejudices,

**[00:19:36]** and the other does the same,

**[00:19:38]** there is no coming together.

**[00:19:40]** You are following all this?

**[00:19:48]** It is important that
we come together in our thinking

**[00:20:00]** so that there is no barrier

**[00:20:03]** between your thinking
and my thinking,

**[00:20:06]** his or hers.

**[00:20:12]** Can we do this together?

**[00:20:19]** Because from this
we can proceed,

**[00:20:26]** because your mind then
has a totally different quality.

**[00:20:34]** It is entirely objective,
nothing personal.

**[00:20:45]** The self-centred problems

**[00:20:49]** with which we are burdened

**[00:20:54]** can never be solved

**[00:20:57]** unless there is
a different quality of thinking

**[00:21:03]** or a different quality
of perception,

**[00:21:11]** a different quality
of insight into the problem.

**[00:21:20]** Right?

**[00:21:22]** I wonder
if you are following all this.

**[00:21:34]** So our question then is:

**[00:21:37]** is it possible that two people,

**[00:21:42]** a group of people,

**[00:21:48]** undertake this responsibility?

**[00:21:58]** That putting aside your anxiety,
attachment, and so on,

**[00:22:10]** and the other – meet,

**[00:22:15]** so that there is never
a question of division,

**[00:22:20]** opinion opposing opinion,

**[00:22:22]** knowledge opposing knowledge,

**[00:22:25]** experience contradicting
another experience

**[00:22:30]** – you are following this?

**[00:22:31]** So that our minds are together.

**[00:22:40]** The totalitarian states
want this.

**[00:22:50]** They are the authority

**[00:22:52]** and they lay down what people
should think, act, and so on.

**[00:23:01]** That is what is happening.

**[00:23:03]** If you disagree,
you are either shot,

**[00:23:06]** sent to a concentration camp,
or exiled.

**[00:23:11]** We are not saying that at all.

**[00:23:14]** On the contrary.

**[00:23:20]** Two minds educated,

**[00:23:27]** concerned with the world

**[00:23:34]** and are committed to find out

**[00:23:40]** whether there is a way out of this,

**[00:23:47]** out of the trap,

**[00:23:48]** out of this terrible mess

**[00:23:50]** that man has created
for himself and for others.

**[00:23:57]** Can we do this together?

**[00:24:01]** Hai capito?

**[00:24:04]** You understand the question now?

**[00:24:08]** Together – our minds are equal,

**[00:24:15]** so the speaker is not telling you
what to do,

**[00:24:21]** and you obey,
or disregard, or accept,

**[00:24:26]** but our minds are together,

**[00:24:32]** being free to solve our problems.

**[00:24:38]** Right?

**[00:24:42]** Can we do this?

**[00:24:47]** Will you give up
your Zen meditation,

**[00:24:53]** give up your particular guru?

**[00:24:58]** Give up your belief,

**[00:25:02]** your own experience
to which you cling to,

**[00:25:09]** your own personal
self-interested problems,

**[00:25:15]** let go
and then meet together.

**[00:25:19]** Do you see what takes place
if you can do this?

**[00:25:30]** Then we can investigate together

**[00:25:33]** every problem very simply
and clearly and directly, and act.

**[00:25:41]** That is clarity.

**[00:25:46]** To observe,

**[00:25:51]** to see without any distortion,

**[00:25:55]** to listen completely

**[00:26:00]** without making an abstraction

**[00:26:03]** of what you are listening to
into an idea.

**[00:26:08]** Therefore there is only listening,

**[00:26:12]** there is only then seeing,

**[00:26:16]** not you see and I see differently,
there is only seeing together.

**[00:26:39]** Right?

**[00:26:44]** You see,
we have instantly moved away

**[00:26:48]** from our own little sphere,

**[00:26:52]** from our own backyard,

**[00:26:59]** from our own self-concerned
innumerable problems.

**[00:27:11]** Have you?

**[00:27:12]** Please, this is serious
if we want to talk together,

**[00:27:16]** this is really important.

**[00:27:21]** Or do you carry the burden

**[00:27:24]** of all the troubles, anxieties,
griefs and sorrows,

**[00:27:30]** and try to listen to another fellow,
to what he is talking about?

**[00:27:39]** If you do that,

**[00:27:41]** then you are trying to conform
to the pattern set by another,

**[00:27:52]** obviously,

**[00:27:57]** and so there is always division.

**[00:28:02]** Right?

**[00:28:08]** So we are asking
something very serious,

**[00:28:16]** and as you have taken the trouble
to come into this tent

**[00:28:23]** – expenditure, energy,

**[00:28:26]** petrol, and all the rest of it –

**[00:28:32]** are we together thinking?

**[00:28:47]** Not you think and I think
– thinking together.

**[00:29:06]** Then we can go
into this question of time,

**[00:29:16]** – thinking together –
not your time, my time.

**[00:29:25]** It is very important

**[00:29:27]** because we are going to find out
if we think together,

**[00:29:30]** whether there is
psychologically tomorrow at all,

**[00:29:42]** because that may be
either an illusion or a reality:

**[00:29:53]** that there is
psychologically tomorrow

**[00:29:58]** – tomorrow means many,
many tomorrows.

**[00:30:05]** Either that may be an illusion,

**[00:30:10]** and so, being an illusion,
we can put that aside

**[00:30:15]** and face this question

**[00:30:19]** whether there is psychologically

**[00:30:23]** a progressive evolutionary
movement, which is time.

**[00:30:31]** I wonder if you follow all this?

**[00:30:35]** Are you used to my language
and therefore you can go to sleep?

**[00:30:42]** You might say, ‘Oh, yes,
I have heard all this before’.

**[00:30:52]** If you so think,

**[00:30:57]** then you are not
discovering for yourself,

**[00:31:02]** you are not
thinking together.

**[00:31:09]** You have already stopped
thinking together and say,

**[00:31:13]** ‘I’ve heard it before’.

**[00:31:18]** Because we are going
very, very deeply into this

**[00:31:24]** therefore it is
the first time you hear it.

**[00:31:31]** The speaker has been talking
in this tent for the last 19 years,

**[00:31:37]** next year it will be 20 years.

**[00:31:41]** And probably you will
all turn up and say,

**[00:31:44]** ‘Oh, lord, he is back again,
caught in a rut’.

**[00:31:53]** We are not caught in a rut.

**[00:31:57]** We are free to listen,
to observe,

**[00:32:07]** and that very observation,

**[00:32:28]** listening reveals the truth,

**[00:32:33]** not the idea about truth.

**[00:32:38]** So we are asking
a very serious question,

**[00:32:44]** because all our conditioning,
all our education,

**[00:32:47]** both religious,

**[00:32:52]** personal and worldly,

**[00:32:55]** is allowing or giving time
to achieve something.

**[00:33:03]** One needs time to learn a language,

**[00:33:07]** one needs time to learn
how to drive a car,

**[00:33:15]** time is necessary for acquiring
skill, technological skill.

**[00:33:21]** To be a good carpenter,
you need time.

**[00:33:29]** But we are asking
something entirely different.

**[00:33:33]** There time is necessary.

**[00:33:36]** Psychologically

**[00:33:39]** – please, bear in mind
we are thinking together,

**[00:33:41]** not what you think,
time is necessary or not.

**[00:33:46]** We are investigating together,

**[00:33:51]** therefore you are free
to look, to question, ask.

**[00:33:58]** You cannot enquire, demand,
be sceptical if you just say,

**[00:34:05]** ‘I’ll hold on to my knowledge,
I think time is necessary’,

**[00:34:09]** and so on
– then we don’t meet together.

**[00:34:12]** We are thinking together

**[00:34:14]** about the whole question
of psychological evolution.

**[00:34:23]** Because man
throughout the millennia,

**[00:34:28]** has been accustomed,
is used, conditioned

**[00:34:33]** to think that he will evolve.

**[00:34:40]** ‘I am this today’.

**[00:34:42]** ‘Give me time to change’.

**[00:34:47]** ‘I am envious, frightened,

**[00:34:52]** burdened with enormous sorrow

**[00:34:59]** and I must have time
to get over it, to go beyond it’.

**[00:35:05]** This is what we are used to.

**[00:35:11]** So the speaker is saying

**[00:35:15]** whether such psychological evolution
exists at all.

**[00:35:21]** Or it is the invention of thought

**[00:35:29]** because it says,
‘I cannot change today,

**[00:35:32]** give me time, for god’s sake,
tomorrow’.

**[00:35:39]** The everlasting becoming.

**[00:35:43]** ‘I will be successful
as an executive,

**[00:35:46]** as a first-class engineer,
or a first-class carpenter’.

**[00:35:53]** All this needs skill
and you need time.

**[00:35:59]** But we are asking:

**[00:36:02]** is there psychological
evolution at all

**[00:36:07]** – the ‘me’ becoming something?

**[00:36:11]** You understand?

**[00:36:14]** We are thinking together,

**[00:36:16]** not about whether time
exists psychologically or not.

**[00:36:22]** We are thinking together,

**[00:36:24]** therefore there is no opposition.

**[00:36:29]** Right?

**[00:36:35]** So let us examine

**[00:36:40]** the whole conditioning of becoming

**[00:36:47]** – together, you understand? –
don’t come to any conclusion.

**[00:36:52]** Or if you have conclusions,
let go and find out.

**[00:36:59]** You see the problem?

**[00:37:02]** If one’s conditioning
allows time,

**[00:37:10]** then you are caught
in the whole movement of becoming.

**[00:37:19]** That is, I am angry, one is angry,
allow time to dissolve that anger.

**[00:37:32]** That is one’s conditioning,
that’s one’s habit.

**[00:37:36]** And if you cling to that,
we cannot think together.

**[00:37:43]** Therefore it is important
to find out

**[00:37:48]** if you are clinging to something

**[00:37:51]** and at the same time
trying to think together.

**[00:37:56]** Right?

**[00:38:00]** If I cling to my belief,

**[00:38:03]** to my experience
according to that belief,

**[00:38:10]** and you likewise,

**[00:38:13]** we can never think together,

**[00:38:19]** we can never
co-operate together,

**[00:38:22]** there is no action
which is not divisive.

**[00:38:29]** You are following?

**[00:38:32]** So are we prepared
to investigate together

**[00:38:38]** – investigate implies
looking, observing, thinking –

**[00:38:44]** rationally, sanely,
patiently, deeply.

**[00:38:56]** Is one free to enquire
into this question:

**[00:39:04]** the me, the self-centred activity,
the constant movement,

**[00:39:12]** whether you are asleep, awake,
walking, dreaming, talking,

**[00:39:16]** it is this constant
central activity of me.

**[00:39:25]** Has that a tomorrow,
a progressive ending of it?

**[00:39:30]** Or a progressive continuity of it,
a refinement of it?

**[00:39:39]** All that demands tomorrow.

**[00:39:51]** Now, psychologically,
is there a tomorrow?

**[00:39:56]** Please, this is
a very serious question.

**[00:40:10]** The speaker put this question
to somebody some time ago,

**[00:40:15]** and the person said,

**[00:40:17]** ‘Oh, lord, I am going
to meet my husband tomorrow’.

**[00:40:24]** You understand?

**[00:40:26]** Oh, come on, there is
nothing difficult, don’t be puzzled.

**[00:40:30]** All her hope, pleasure
– you follow? –

**[00:40:34]** the whole memory of the husband,

**[00:40:39]** and if there is no tomorrow,
what is my husband?

**[00:40:45]** Right?

**[00:40:51]** Please, together.

**[00:40:56]** We are free together
to enquire into this question.

**[00:41:02]** The speaker is not imposing
a thing on you.

**[00:41:11]** But it is very important to find out
if there is a tomorrow.

**[00:41:23]** If there is no tomorrow,
what takes place?

**[00:41:32]** We know what takes place when we
have allowed multiple tomorrows:

**[00:41:39]** postponement, laziness, indolence,

**[00:41:43]** gradually achieving something,

**[00:41:47]** enlightenment

**[00:41:51]** – you understand? –
Nirvana, all the rest of it.

**[00:41:55]** Through many lives, progress
– you follow?

**[00:41:59]** I wonder if you follow all this,

**[00:42:01]** the seriousness
of this investigation?

**[00:42:10]** If there is no tomorrow
psychologically,

**[00:42:14]** then what happens
to the quality of your mind?

**[00:42:27]** The mind that is thinking together,

**[00:42:35]** what is the quality of the mind

**[00:42:38]** – the mind, not your mind,
my mind –

**[00:42:42]** but the mind

**[00:42:45]** that has seen the whole progressive
movement of the ‘me’ becoming,

**[00:43:11]** that has seen what is involved

**[00:43:17]** in this self-achieving,
self-becoming

**[00:43:36]** and what is involved

**[00:43:39]** when psychologically
there is no tomorrow, no future.

**[00:43:49]** Do you understand, sir?

**[00:44:00]** Psychologically then
there is a tremendous revolution.

**[00:44:06]** Right?

**[00:44:09]** Is this taking place with you,

**[00:44:11]** that is what is important,
not the words,

**[00:44:14]** not the speaker what is stating,
but actually,

**[00:44:21]** actual means that which is
happening now, the actuality,

**[00:44:30]** is the actuality
that in investigating together

**[00:44:42]** the mind has discovered the truth

**[00:44:46]** that there is no tomorrow,
psychologically?

**[00:44:49]** Then what takes place
with the quality of one’s mind?

**[00:44:55]** You understand what I am saying?

**[00:45:04]** All religions, Christian, Catholic,
and all the rest of it,

**[00:45:09]** have all said
tomorrow is important.

**[00:45:19]** Tomorrow in the Christian world,
one life.

**[00:45:24]** When you die, one life only.

**[00:45:27]** The Asiatic world says
multiple lives.

**[00:45:37]** Probably you neither believe
or accept either of those two

**[00:45:42]** – I don’t know.

**[00:45:47]** But when you begin to investigate
the whole psychological movement,

**[00:45:55]** the ‘me’, the ‘X’ becoming,
becoming – you follow? –

**[00:46:01]** what is involved?

**[00:46:04]** Gradually you suffer and
go on gradually lessening suffering

**[00:46:11]** till ultimately you are free,

**[00:46:13]** either in this life
or in successive lives.

**[00:46:19]** The Christians accept
this life, one life,

**[00:46:22]** and the Asiatics accept many,
many lives – you follow?

**[00:46:28]** That is psychologically one life
and psychologically multiple lives.

**[00:46:39]** And together, you and I,
have looked at it

**[00:46:44]** without any prejudice,
without any conclusion,

**[00:46:52]** we are observing the fact,
how people are caught in this.

**[00:47:00]** And also we are asking:

**[00:47:07]** if there is no tomorrow
psychologically,

**[00:47:15]** what has happened to your mind,

**[00:47:19]** to your action, to your behaviour,

**[00:47:24]** to your responsibility?

**[00:47:27]** Do you understand my question?

**[00:47:29]** Have you understood my question
– the question?

**[00:47:37]** What is your conduct
if there is no tomorrow?

**[00:47:46]** Conduct implying responsibility
with regard to another in action.

**[00:48:00]** Do you understand, sir?

**[00:48:05]** Then what is your relationship
to another?

**[00:48:15]** Please,
together we are investigating,

**[00:48:17]** don’t look at me and say,
‘Please, tell me’.

**[00:48:25]** Because there is
no you and I in this thinking,

**[00:48:34]** in this observation,
in this quality of listening.

**[00:48:48]** What is your relationship
with another

**[00:48:58]** when there is no tomorrow
psychologically?

**[00:49:07]** Either you despair,

**[00:49:12]** because this is a shock to one,
do you understand?

**[00:49:18]** Either you despair

**[00:49:21]** or you give up and say,
‘I don’t know’ – throw it out.

**[00:49:29]** But if you are committed
to this thinking together

**[00:49:37]** and enquiring
into the progressive business,

**[00:49:46]** and ending of today psychologically,

**[00:49:54]** then what takes place actually

**[00:49:57]** – actually in the sense
that which is happening now

**[00:50:01]** in your relationship with another?

**[00:50:15]** Relationship being
not only physical contact,

**[00:50:20]** sex, and all the rest of it,

**[00:50:22]** but also the psychological
relationship of dependence,

**[00:50:28]** attachment,

**[00:50:31]** comfort, loneliness,
all the rest of it,

**[00:50:39]** what takes place?

**[00:50:57]** Would you tell me?

**[00:51:08]** Or is this totally new to you?

**[00:51:14]** You are listening
for the first time

**[00:51:22]** and therefore there is
no immediate response.

**[00:51:32]** Right?

**[00:51:33]** And why not?

**[00:51:37]** You are following all this?
I wonder if you are.

**[00:51:51]** If there is no future,

**[00:51:55]** no future,

**[00:52:01]** the future to which you are
accustomed to, we know very well:

**[00:52:08]** the picture, the image,
the pleasure,

**[00:52:13]** desire for success,
spiritual and worldly,

**[00:52:19]** the priest wanting to become bishop,

**[00:52:21]** bishop wanting
to become the cardinal,

**[00:52:23]** the cardinal becoming the pope

**[00:52:24]** – the whole racket of it,

**[00:52:30]** and in the world too,

**[00:52:36]** then, if you see

**[00:52:40]** that implies constant strife,
constant battle,

**[00:52:49]** a ruthless sense of me aggressively
pushing, pushing, pushing.

**[00:52:59]** And so in that aggressive
achievement there is security,

**[00:53:12]** hoping to have security.

**[00:53:16]** And in relationship also
– security in another,

**[00:53:22]** with all its implications:

**[00:53:26]** anxiety, jealousy,
displeasure, tears

**[00:53:33]** – we know all that very well.

**[00:53:38]** But if there is no
progressive tomorrows,

**[00:53:45]** what is one’s relationship
to another, intimate or not?

**[00:53:53]** Go on, sirs, find out.

**[00:54:34]** You see,

**[00:54:39]** if you have understood
the quality of thinking together,

**[00:54:49]** thinking together,
not about something,

**[00:54:54]** but thinking together,
you and I,

**[00:55:03]** then where does
that thinking together

**[00:55:09]** lead in my relationship to another?

**[00:55:14]** You are following?

**[00:55:16]** The other doesn’t know
anything about all this, suppose.

**[00:55:24]** The other is attached,
and all the rest of it,

**[00:55:27]** what is your relationship
to the other

**[00:55:30]** if there is this quality of thinking

**[00:55:33]** which is absolutely together,
this is not divisive?

**[00:55:53]** Do you want me to tell you?

**[00:55:55]** Questioner: No, sir.
K: Quite right, sir.

**[00:56:06]** When you said, ‘No, sir’,
then we are together.

**[00:56:11]** Q: Not quite, sir.

**[00:56:20]** K: You see,
that is our difficulty.

**[00:56:26]** You want to think
together with me,

**[00:56:31]** and I can’t let go my ambition,
my vanity, my prejudice.

**[00:56:41]** I can’t let go because you say,
‘Look, let’s think together,

**[00:56:47]** so that we have this quality,

**[00:56:49]** this spirit of actual
co-operation in thinking’.

**[00:56:56]** And I can’t,

**[00:57:00]** because I am attached
to my thinking,

**[00:57:05]** to my memories, to my experience,
to my accumulated knowledge.

**[00:57:11]** So it is I who have created
the division, not you.

**[00:57:17]** You understand?

**[00:57:19]** You understand this?
Are you doing that?

**[00:57:23]** Because if you are thinking
having that spirit,

**[00:57:28]** then if there is no tomorrow,
what?

**[00:57:32]** You are missing the whole thing,
come on, sir!

**[00:57:43]** This is exactly what is going on
between you and the speaker.

**[00:57:56]** The speaker says, ‘I have no
personal problems’, which is a fact.

**[00:58:02]** ‘I have no belief’,
which is a fact.

**[00:58:05]** ‘I have no experience’.

**[00:58:10]** I have had a great many but I don’t
carry them, they have gone.

**[00:58:17]** I am not entrenched in my particular
opinion, prejudice, evaluations.

**[00:58:28]** Right?
Which is a fact.

**[00:58:30]** I would be a hypocrite
if I said something else.

**[00:58:37]** So I say let’s think together

**[00:58:42]** and see the beauty
of thinking together.

**[00:58:47]** And you say,

**[00:58:48]** ‘How can I let go my knowledge,
my experience,

**[00:58:52]** I can’t, I love them’.

**[00:58:55]** ‘This is my life’.

**[00:59:00]** So you create
a division in the world

**[00:59:09]** – German, national –
you follow?

**[00:59:12]** Both outwardly and inwardly.

**[00:59:16]** And where there is division,
there must be conflict,

**[00:59:21]** that is a law:

**[00:59:25]** the Catholic, the Protestant,
the Communist, the Totalitarian.

**[00:59:37]** So the speaker says,

**[00:59:40]** ‘Please, my friend,
let’s think together’.

**[00:59:50]** You understand, sir,
what has happened?

**[00:59:54]** When we think together,
you have lost all your personality.

**[01:00:01]** Ah, you don’t see it.

**[01:00:04]** You follow?

**[01:00:05]** You are no longer
Mr. Smith and Mr. K.

**[01:00:10]** Oh, come on, sirs!

**[01:00:17]** What time is it, sir?

**[01:00:41]** This is the purpose
of these talks and dialogues

**[01:00:50]** that we together
dissolve all our problems

**[01:01:07]** because the self-centred problem

**[01:01:10]** is greater than
the problems of the world

**[01:01:14]** – political, energy,
various countries divided,

**[01:01:20]** that is nothing compared to this.

**[01:01:23]** Because once you have resolved this,

**[01:01:28]** you are master of the world.

**[01:01:30]** You understand?

**[01:01:35]** Master.
Don’t go off into some...

**[01:01:48]** I think that is enough
for this morning, isn’t it?

**[01:01:52]** Basta?

**[01:01:54]** Bene.
