**[00:00:21]** Krishnamurti: What shall
we talk about this morning?

**[00:00:40]** Questioner:
Could we review the steps

**[00:00:43]** by which we come to the need
not to do anything,

**[00:00:49]** and then try to stay with that issue
for as long as we can?

**[00:01:09]** Q: You said some very
remarkable words, the other day.

**[00:01:21]** You said, ‘I love you
and I want nothing from you’.

**[00:01:26]** K: I withdraw that.

**[00:01:40]** Q: I don’t want the withdrawal.

**[00:01:44]** But I was thinking,
as far as I know,

**[00:01:48]** there are quite a large number
of people here, including myself,

**[00:01:53]** who would say deeply, sincerely,
‘I love you, too’.

**[00:01:58]** But I do want something from you.

**[00:02:03]** I want help, which you
so generously give, at all times,

**[00:02:10]** to lead a better life,
a daily life.

**[00:02:16]** I think the quality of our daily
life is so immensely important.

**[00:02:22]** From the moment we wake in the
morning, till we go to bed at night,

**[00:02:28]** I, personally, fritter away
my energies, fritter away my life.

**[00:02:33]** I think it’s part of education

**[00:02:37]** to learn how to live a single day
without conflict.

**[00:02:56]** Q: This is perhaps entirely off
what Doris just suggested,

**[00:03:03]** but there has been discussion here,
and there is among students too,

**[00:03:11]** on what is the correct way

**[00:03:15]** to try to face the appalling dilemma
of the nuclear threat, of war,

**[00:03:27]** the political maneuverings
of big powers?

**[00:03:32]** That is something
that touches everybody’s life

**[00:03:34]** and yet most of us don’t know
how to meet that.

**[00:03:37]** Do you want to go into that or is
that off what we’re talking about?

**[00:03:43]** K: Would you ask them?

**[00:03:50]** Q: To me, it would be a total waste
of time to talk about nuclear war

**[00:03:55]** while we haven’t solved the problem
of our own simple daily life.

**[00:04:03]** That’s only my view.

**[00:04:04]** Q: But isn’t part of the same thing?

**[00:04:08]** Q: Even to link the two is,
to my mind, an escape.

**[00:04:14]** Q: Yes, what sort of link
is possible

**[00:04:16]** in the sense that we’re feeling

**[00:04:21]** that there is very little
we can do directly

**[00:04:24]** to affect major world issues,

**[00:04:26]** but there are nevertheless things
we can do at a personal level

**[00:04:31]** which do, in some ways that,
perhaps, we don’t understand,

**[00:04:35]** have an effect
on these major world issues.

**[00:04:38]** Not directly,
not through political action,

**[00:04:41]** but through our own consciousness.
Q: That may be.

**[00:04:45]** Q: This is an idea
that’s beginning to form in my mind.

**[00:04:49]** I don’t fully understand it,

**[00:04:52]** but it perhaps represents

**[00:04:54]** the only possible alternative
to direct action

**[00:04:57]** which simply doesn’t seem to work.

**[00:05:02]** Q: Do you mean that we can only
do something on a personal level

**[00:05:06]** and that it is absolutely useless
to join some sort of movement,

**[00:05:12]** preferably a peaceful movement,
a non-violent movement?

**[00:05:16]** That the uselessness
of most actions nowadays,

**[00:05:22]** is due to the fact that there are
too many small organisations.

**[00:05:29]** They are all working in the same
direction, but without any unity.

**[00:05:34]** And if a great man or somebody
would take the lead

**[00:05:39]** and try to unite these movements
in a non-violent action,

**[00:05:44]** I think it would be better
than what is being done now.

**[00:06:06]** Q: We’ve more or less in this group
come to see

**[00:06:09]** that what is required
is a change of perspective.

**[00:06:12]** Not a different
or better organisation

**[00:06:15]** of existing organisations,

**[00:06:18]** but a different perspective.

**[00:06:21]** I think it would be valuable

**[00:06:26]** if we could dwell on that, somewhat.

**[00:06:37]** Q: Can you say what you mean
by a change of perspective?

**[00:06:44]** K: Apparently, France, England,
Israel, and Gadhafi,

**[00:06:53]** India, America
and Russia, of course,

**[00:06:57]** have the atomic bomb.

**[00:07:09]** And Russia – I’m just
observing things as they are,

**[00:07:14]** I’m not taking sides
in this matter –

**[00:07:18]** Russia is in Africa, Angola,
the Cubans are there,

**[00:07:28]** Russia is in Afghanistan,

**[00:07:35]** Russia has its army, two hundred and
fifty thousand men in East Germany.

**[00:07:45]** You know what it’s like in Poland,
what is going on there,

**[00:07:51]** Romania,

**[00:07:53]** and all these countries
are subjugated to Russia,

**[00:07:57]** tyrannised and so on.

**[00:08:03]** And do we encourage Russia
by not thinking about all this?

**[00:08:11]** Or thinking about it?

**[00:08:14]** You understand?

**[00:08:16]** Russia is spreading aggressively
– there is no doubt about that.

**[00:08:24]** Do I not think about it, say,
‘The moment I think about it,

**[00:08:29]** I’m encouraging Russia
to be more aggressive’?

**[00:08:34]** That’s one point.
And the other point is,

**[00:08:41]** apparently, all these countries,
more or less,

**[00:08:45]** can develop the nuclear bomb.

**[00:08:53]** And what is one to do
with all this going on?

**[00:09:01]** The authorities don’t seem
to be able to deal with it,

**[00:09:09]** the spreading proliferation
of the nuclear bomb.

**[00:09:17]** The organised religions,
which have tremendous power,

**[00:09:22]** don’t go against it.

**[00:09:27]** Am I right or wrong?

**[00:09:29]** Q: Some do in some countries,
particularly in Holland.

**[00:09:33]** K: Holland is a small country.

**[00:09:35]** Q: They have started
in Germany, too.

**[00:09:37]** K: I know that, but I’m talking
about organised religion.

**[00:09:43]** The Catholic world doesn’t say,

**[00:09:49]** ‘I’ll excommunicate anybody
who takes part’.

**[00:09:54]** Q: Certainly.
K: They don’t do that.

**[00:09:58]** If they did,
they would be wiped out.

**[00:10:02]** So, organised resistance to all this

**[00:10:06]** apparently doesn’t do
anything either

**[00:10:10]** – demonstration – that’s been
going on in Germany, in America,

**[00:10:17]** a little bit in India,
in Germany too, in England too,

**[00:10:23]** but apparently,
that does very little.

**[00:10:28]** So, what is one to do?

**[00:10:31]** Join a group that says
we’re anti-nuclear business?

**[00:10:43]** And you know that doesn’t do
very much either.

**[00:10:53]** Q: It may depend
on how many people join.

**[00:10:59]** K: The moment lots of people,
a million join, say for instance,

**[00:11:05]** ten million as in Poland
against all that’s taking place –

**[00:11:11]** there will always be contention
in the organisation

**[00:11:15]** – which way to do it?

**[00:11:20]** Right, sir?
So, what is one to do?

**[00:11:25]** Not think about all this?

**[00:11:27]** Every morning, the newspapers
have headlines about all this.

**[00:11:35]** Q: Isn’t the first thing to see
that all political action is wrong?

**[00:11:41]** K: It’s obvious.

**[00:11:44]** Q: But part of the problem is
that many of these organisations

**[00:11:47]** that are supposed to be
thinking about these issues

**[00:11:53]** turn political, and the moment...

**[00:11:56]** K: They’re also in great difficulty.
Q: Yes, they are.

**[00:11:59]** K: Because what are they to do?
You probably heard last night,

**[00:12:05]** Labour talking about not having
nuclear bombs in England.

**[00:12:11]** Q: Nobody listens to them.
Q: Yes, they do.

**[00:12:14]** Q: I actually had it recorded
so that we could listen to it.

**[00:12:18]** Q: Yes, when I say listen,

**[00:12:21]** I mean nobody really
takes any serious note.

**[00:12:26]** Q: But can we take
a concrete example, please?

**[00:12:28]** Now France has a new government.

**[00:12:33]** The French President
of the Republic,

**[00:12:35]** is a man who always said
he was against atomic weapons.

**[00:12:40]** K: But did you read
this morning’s paper?

**[00:12:43]** Q: Yes, that’s why I…
K: They’re talking about atomic…

**[00:12:46]** Q: The neutron bomb.

**[00:12:48]** On the same day he inaugurates
the United Nations conference

**[00:12:53]** for poor countries
and a nuclear submarine.

**[00:12:59]** Today he says he’s going
to manufacture the neutron bomb.

**[00:13:10]** So, all this is probably a dilemma
for the men in power.

**[00:13:15]** K: Neutron bomb. Kill the people
but keep the buildings going.

**[00:13:20]** Lovely idea!
Q: Who for?

**[00:13:24]** K: A splendid idea.

**[00:13:33]** Q: But Krishnaji,
we talked about this the other day

**[00:13:36]** and quite a few people understand
that there’s violence in me

**[00:13:44]** and I must look at that,

**[00:13:46]** but perhaps also,
I should join some organisation

**[00:13:50]** which is non-political and which is
against the bomb for my country.

**[00:13:58]** Like, for example, in England,
I join an organisation

**[00:14:01]** which is non-political but it is
for unilateral disarmament.

**[00:14:07]** Q: How can it be non-political?
You’re trying to influence politics?

**[00:14:12]** Q: It’s not my opinion.
Q: No, I know.

**[00:14:16]** Q: What jolly good will it do?

**[00:14:18]** Q: In this morning and
yesterday’s Herald Tribune,

**[00:14:23]** it’s reported that Haig
has modified his views

**[00:14:27]** about the deployment of arms

**[00:14:29]** in view of the peace movement
in Europe.

**[00:14:36]** Q: Krishnaji, we’ve got the problem
or possibility of nuclear war…

**[00:14:43]** K: I doubt it, sir, I doubt it.

**[00:14:47]** I doubt they would be
crazy enough to do that.

**[00:14:53]** Q: You doubt or you hope?

**[00:14:57]** K: I doubt it very much.

**[00:15:00]** Q: Then, sir, for instance

**[00:15:01]** we can also address ourselves
to another problem,

**[00:15:04]** approached in the same way,

**[00:15:05]** which is hunger
and the starving people.

**[00:15:10]** Do we join political organisations
to approach that?

**[00:15:13]** In view of all the insanity and
suffering that goes on in the world,

**[00:15:18]** is a political approach
ever appropriate?

**[00:15:24]** Is an organised, social approach
what one should engage in?

**[00:15:31]** K: Suppose, sir, every
little country had a neutron bomb.

**[00:15:38]** Every country. Perhaps
that would solve the problem.

**[00:15:44]** Why not?
It’s as crazy as the other.

**[00:15:50]** They all would know
the danger of it.

**[00:15:56]** Perhaps, that may be the way out.

**[00:15:57]** Q: But, sir, when you take the level
of the heads of some governments…

**[00:16:03]** If you give it to Idi Amin
or Gadhafi or…

**[00:16:09]** K: My grandmother too, included.

**[00:16:19]** Q: Krishnaji,
the question seems to be

**[00:16:24]** what is right action?

**[00:16:26]** What is one to do?
How is one to live?

**[00:16:29]** K: Sir, if you have votes,
you elect the right kind of people.

**[00:16:34]** Q: Also,
I think it’s very significant

**[00:16:36]** what Jim Fowler just said,

**[00:16:38]** that Haig has thought twice
about what he came over to do

**[00:16:44]** because of the energy of the people
in the countries that he went to.

**[00:16:49]** K: They need petrol, so Saudi Arabia
– don’t talk about it.

**[00:16:55]** Q: I’ve seen it myself.

**[00:17:02]** Q: Non-political action
is significant

**[00:17:04]** in one very important respect,

**[00:17:07]** in that movements,
such as the anti-nuclear movement

**[00:17:11]** have tended to be associated
with particular political opinions.

**[00:17:20]** And I think that this, in a sense,
has diminished their value.

**[00:17:28]** There is definitely a possibility
for movements which are apolitical

**[00:17:34]** but which must nevertheless
work in the political arena

**[00:17:36]** because it’s a political reality
that we’re dealing with.

**[00:17:42]** I feel some degree of hope
that there’s a possibility

**[00:17:45]** of a depolarisation of political
opinion into areas such as that.

**[00:17:55]** K: You heard last night the Labour
Party saying no atomic bombs,

**[00:18:01]** withdrawing from the Common Market,

**[00:18:05]** but Britain is also
selling armaments.

**[00:18:09]** On one hand you say all this,

**[00:18:11]** on the other hand
you encourage every…

**[00:18:17]** Q: When you say
vote for the right people,

**[00:18:20]** that’s what most French people
thought when they voted.

**[00:18:24]** You vote for the right people
and when they are in power,

**[00:18:27]** you discover
they’re the wrong people.

**[00:18:29]** K: Yes, they go mad.

**[00:18:31]** Q: Power corrupts.

**[00:18:34]** K: So, what’s the good
of talking about it?

**[00:18:38]** Q: Could one try it like this?

**[00:18:42]** I will only act, if at all,
with other people

**[00:18:47]** where there’s a sense of cooperation

**[00:18:49]** which has nothing to do
with a common cause

**[00:18:52]** but is something which actually
one can work from day by day

**[00:18:57]** and is not brought together
by any particular belief.

**[00:19:02]** From there, things may happen,
like this school, or other things.

**[00:19:08]** But I won’t join a group
because of a principle.

**[00:19:13]** Q: Then why join?
Q: Exactly.

**[00:19:16]** Q: Why would you seek out a group?
Q: I wouldn’t.

**[00:19:21]** Q: Then there would be no problem
because you simply wouldn’t join.

**[00:19:25]** Q: I’m trying to approach this
from this starting point,

**[00:19:29]** with whom will one cooperate?

**[00:19:30]** And in what way can one

**[00:19:34]** to do something which won’t become
divided and troublesome?

**[00:19:39]** Q: We don’t know
how to cooperate, do we?

**[00:19:42]** Q: How would Haig be aware

**[00:19:44]** of this resistance
to the deployment of the arms,

**[00:19:47]** if it hadn’t been organised?

**[00:19:52]** Q: Whatever the consequences of that
is not of fundamental significance

**[00:19:56]** to what we’re trying
to talk about at this moment.

**[00:19:59]** Over a perspective
of 10 or 20 years,

**[00:20:01]** one can’t tell what the significance

**[00:20:03]** of Haig’s relationship to a peace
movement of Europe will be.

**[00:20:06]** I doubt that nuclear arms will have
vanished from Russia and America

**[00:20:08]** in twenty years’ time,

**[00:20:09]** as a result
of Haig’s visit to Europe.

**[00:20:14]** Q: It’s highly significant

**[00:20:15]** because he has actually
modified his intentions

**[00:20:18]** purely because
of the peace movement.

**[00:20:20]** Q: It’s significant to you, Jim,
it’s not significant to me.

**[00:20:31]** It’s the inability of people
to work together with cooperation

**[00:20:34]** for a period longer
than two or three days,

**[00:20:37]** that’s really significant

**[00:20:39]** – except when they’re held together
by some cause

**[00:20:41]** and then they do something over
a period of months or years,

**[00:20:43]** but then that turns out
to be dangerous in another way.

**[00:20:47]** Q: So, you’re asking, does it need
a cause for people to cooperate?

**[00:20:51]** Usually the way of cooperation
is to join a cause

**[00:20:55]** and then you cooperate through that
rather narrow cause.

**[00:21:03]** Q: Is that a question we could
look at as a starting point?

**[00:21:08]** Q: I’m inclined to think

**[00:21:10]** if the cause is
sufficiently well-identified

**[00:21:12]** then it makes cooperation easier.

**[00:21:15]** There are examples of small groups

**[00:21:20]** having effect on large organisations

**[00:21:23]** because their cause
has been relatively simple.

**[00:21:26]** One that comes to mind
is an organisation called CAMRA

**[00:21:34]** – the Campaign for Real Ale –

**[00:21:36]** which persuaded the large brewers
to improve the quality of their beer

**[00:21:42]** by action which was located

**[00:21:53]** with a very small organisation.

**[00:21:56]** Q: I think we’re missing a point.
I don’t think we’re discussing ale.

**[00:22:01]** We’re concerned more with the fact
that each of us, by our behaviour

**[00:22:08]** is creating confusion in the world

**[00:22:10]** and creating these
kinds of conflicts

**[00:22:12]** that we’ve been describing.

**[00:22:14]** We are responsible for what’s going
on in the world, by our behaviour.

**[00:22:18]** I think we’re moving away
from that fact.

**[00:22:23]** Q: But there seem
to be possibilities

**[00:22:24]** of both sorts of action,

**[00:22:26]** in the sense, individual action,
if we can use that term,

**[00:22:29]** and collective action,

**[00:22:30]** providing the objective
is well defined.

**[00:22:34]** Q: While we’re deciding how to act,
it’s bound to go wrong.

**[00:22:40]** If we get away
from this compulsion to act,

**[00:22:44]** our action may be effective.

**[00:22:47]** It may be in the outward field or
it may be in a small, local field.

**[00:22:50]** But if we’re discussing
how we ought to act,

**[00:22:54]** then I don’t see
that any of our actions

**[00:22:56]** can be particularly effective.

**[00:22:59]** Q: Would you say, Brian,
then that pacifism has a cause?

**[00:23:03]** Q: Oh, yes.

**[00:23:05]** Q: I wonder the real
meaning of pacifism.

**[00:23:10]** Q: Does it have a cause,
not is it a cause?

**[00:23:12]** Q: That can be a sort of action,
can’t it, a certain passivity.

**[00:23:16]** Q: By the time you’ve used the word,
it’s a cause, isn’t it?

**[00:23:18]** A cause you follow, you join,
you adhere to…

**[00:23:21]** Q: No, I wouldn’t actually
join the cause as such.

**[00:23:24]** It seems to stem
from a human response to…

**[00:23:28]** Q: Would you call
yourself a pacifist?

**[00:23:29]** Q: No, I wouldn’t actually, no.

**[00:23:31]** Q: So then the word
doesn’t have to be used,

**[00:23:33]** but the action may still be there.

**[00:23:35]** K: Sir, would you consider
my suggestion a little bit, now?

**[00:23:44]** Personally, I can’t physically
do anything.

**[00:23:49]** The thing is rolling, gathering.

**[00:23:53]** I can’t stop it, personally,

**[00:23:56]** nor you as any person
stop this wave that’s going on.

**[00:24:06]** We can observe what is happening,
very clearly,

**[00:24:11]** the aggression of one country
spreading,

**[00:24:15]** trying to influence
all the other countries,

**[00:24:19]** from Afghanistan to Cuba.
Cubans in Angola.

**[00:24:27]** It’s a potty little country.
You follow?

**[00:24:33]** K: These are the facts.

**[00:24:36]** France said,
‘We won’t have the atomic bomb’,

**[00:24:39]** now it says, ‘We must have it’.

**[00:24:42]** They are all cultivating this thing.

**[00:24:45]** These are all facts.

**[00:24:47]** Tremendous aggression
on the part of one country

**[00:24:52]** and perhaps,
less on the part of other countries.

**[00:24:57]** Looking at all that,
what am I to do?

**[00:25:06]** My talking to people
will have very little effect.

**[00:25:13]** Q: Yes.

**[00:25:15]** K: Perhaps I have talked
to some prominent politicians

**[00:25:20]** and they say, ‘Yes, go and talk
to the other country and stop them

**[00:25:25]** and then I’ll stop’.

**[00:25:26]** This has been the argument.

**[00:25:31]** I have seen all this.

**[00:25:35]** So, what am I to do?

**[00:25:37]** I can talk, write, shout,
but it has very little effect.

**[00:25:46]** Is there another level of
consciousness which we can touch?

**[00:25:54]** You follow
what I’m trying to get at?

**[00:26:01]** Instead of joining groups, shouting,

**[00:26:03]** demonstrations
and all the rest of it,

**[00:26:06]** which seems to have
very little effect,

**[00:26:11]** is there another form
of communication,

**[00:26:17]** which is not merely verbal,
not violent or anti-violent?

**[00:26:26]** Is there a level of communication,

**[00:26:32]** which unconsciously
people can capture?

**[00:26:39]** Am I conveying this?

**[00:26:42]** Q: You’re suggesting that this isn’t
just tied to one issue but to all.

**[00:26:46]** K: I’m talking of all issues.
The whole thing.

**[00:26:50]** The whole lot, yes,
the whole bag full.

**[00:26:57]** Q: Krishnaji, I don’t want to play
devil’s advocate here

**[00:27:01]** but the common opinion – you said
that demonstrations and the shouting

**[00:27:07]** and the marching
doesn’t have any effect.

**[00:27:09]** K: Very little effect, I said.

**[00:27:11]** Q: The argument is that we’re simply
not doing it well enough.

**[00:27:15]** We need more people,
be better organised,

**[00:27:17]** shout louder, march farther

**[00:27:20]** gather more numbers.
K: But they are doing that.

**[00:27:24]** They are doing that very well.

**[00:27:28]** Q: Well, people say
that it’s not well enough,

**[00:27:29]** we need more numbers still.

**[00:27:31]** K: What is happening in Ulster
and so on and so on,

**[00:27:34]** this is all fairly obvious.
Right?

**[00:27:38]** Q: Well, it’s not so obvious,
apparently.

**[00:27:40]** K: Obvious, in the sense,
it is having very little effect.

**[00:27:51]** Atomic bomb or the nuclear bomb
is being developed by countries.

**[00:27:57]** There is no question about it.

**[00:28:00]** We are not going to stop it,

**[00:28:02]** except if all the world’s scientists
said, ‘Sorry, we won’t do it’,

**[00:28:08]** all of them,

**[00:28:09]** then there’s a possibility.

**[00:28:11]** But the scientists
are not doing that.

**[00:28:15]** Q: High school students
can build them

**[00:28:17]** – you don’t even need a scientist.

**[00:28:19]** K: The heads of the really powerful
religions are not saying, ‘Stop it’.

**[00:28:27]** Q: You’re saying, Krishnaji,
in fact,

**[00:28:29]** that no amount
of demonstrating and...

**[00:28:32]** K: It has very little effect.

**[00:28:35]** Q: But Krishnaji
– granted that it’s limited…

**[00:28:39]** K: Agreed.
Q: …it has had an effect

**[00:28:41]** that made for great change
in various instances.

**[00:28:45]** K: In certain incidents, I agree.
Q: So people pursue that.

**[00:28:50]** K: But I’m talking about war,
the nuclear bomb.

**[00:28:54]** Will demonstrations stop it?

**[00:29:02]** Q: It seems that any demonstration
by any group or organisation

**[00:29:10]** really seems to be the other end
of the same movement.

**[00:29:17]** In their very demonstration,
there is the same aggression.

**[00:29:22]** K: Let us say demonstrations,
newspapers, have some effect,

**[00:29:31]** but that little effect
doesn’t stop this,

**[00:29:36]** because of nationalism, competition,
all that is involved in all this

**[00:29:41]** – the desire for one nation to be
more powerful than the other –

**[00:29:48]** we must be the first,
and so on.

**[00:29:50]** Knowing all this, what is a person
who is fairly intelligent,

**[00:29:55]** who has observed all this,
what is he to do?

**[00:30:01]** He can’t go back and say,
‘Let’s pray’

**[00:30:04]** – that has no meaning.

**[00:30:07]** So, I’m just wondering,

**[00:30:09]** I’m not saying
this is right or wrong,

**[00:30:12]** whether there is not a different
avenue of communication.

**[00:30:21]** Not only to the people in power,

**[00:30:25]** and perhaps they may
not pay attention at all

**[00:30:28]** to that form of communication,

**[00:30:30]** but is there a form of communication
which is not media and all that?

**[00:30:38]** A different movement.

**[00:30:44]** Am I saying something?
Has it some kind of meaning?

**[00:30:48]** Q: It doesn’t depend
on what one says or does.

**[00:30:52]** K: What one says and does,
we have done enough.

**[00:30:56]** It has had some effect,
probably more than we realise,

**[00:31:03]** but that doesn’t seem
to end this crazy business.

**[00:31:15]** Q: We’ve been thinking about our
relationship with other individuals,

**[00:31:21]** but now we’re thinking
about international problems.

**[00:31:25]** One tends to separate the two

**[00:31:26]** but if you read in the paper that
Russia has moved into Afghanistan,

**[00:31:32]** can one, in relation to that

**[00:31:34]** in the same way
that one is to other people,

**[00:31:37]** not fear,
seeing it without a reaction?

**[00:31:49]** Q: Yesterday, we were saying

**[00:31:51]** there is this field
of human consciousness

**[00:31:54]** where there’s memory
and there’s knowledge

**[00:31:57]** and all these actions that we’ve
been performing for millennia,

**[00:32:01]** and that any movement inside
of this, is just the same old thing.

**[00:32:06]** Either that applies
to this situation as well,

**[00:32:10]** or it doesn’t seem to have
very much meaning.

**[00:32:16]** K: Look, sir,
just take you and I.

**[00:32:20]** I’ve talked to you,
you’ve talked to me, a great deal.

**[00:32:25]** We’re part of all this mess.

**[00:32:31]** My verbal expression, explanation
has very little effect – suppose.

**[00:32:40]** I must find a way of communicating
with you, not at the verbal level,

**[00:32:49]** because I’ve tried that

**[00:32:52]** – written level, verbal level,
demonstrative level,

**[00:32:57]** example level, and so on, so on –

**[00:33:01]** that doesn’t have tremendous effect,

**[00:33:06]** that doesn’t, let’s say it
doesn’t change you, completely.

**[00:33:12]** So, I must find a way
of communicating with you,

**[00:33:17]** which is not this.

**[00:33:20]** Is there such a communication?
That’s what I’m asking.

**[00:33:29]** Q: We all have had
some experience and evidence

**[00:33:32]** that such communication does exist.

**[00:33:35]** K: I’m not talking telepathic
or hypnotic communication

**[00:33:42]** or some kind
of mystical communication

**[00:33:46]** but I want to find a communication.

**[00:33:48]** I think there is. Let’s investigate.
I would like to discuss it.

**[00:33:57]** Q: If we look at these discussions,

**[00:34:00]** at the verbal level
each one is different

**[00:34:03]** and if it just stayed at that level,
each one would remain so.

**[00:34:06]** But because there’s something
going on at the non-verbal level

**[00:34:09]** which is immovable
and the same throughout,

**[00:34:12]** each discussion has the same form
and the same resolution.

**[00:34:16]** K: What is that communication?
Let’s talk it over, shall we?

**[00:34:22]** Please, join me.
What is that communication?

**[00:34:31]** I used to know a Benedictine monk.

**[00:34:35]** He used to come to Saanen often

**[00:34:41]** and we used to talk together.

**[00:34:44]** He agreed, he went into all this,
he discussed.

**[00:34:47]** Frightfully intelligent,
in the normal sense of that word,

**[00:34:51]** but he was anchored
in his order, Jesus,

**[00:34:56]** the whole 2,000 years of tradition.

**[00:35:05]** I haven’t seen him
for many years now.

**[00:35:09]** And I used to know
one of the high Jesuits.

**[00:35:13]** Again, he was anchored in that,
though he left the order.

**[00:35:21]** There must be a communication,
which is non-verbal, non-example,

**[00:35:28]** non-demonstrative,

**[00:35:29]** which will affect them profoundly

**[00:35:33]** – you follow what I mean? –
not just superficially.

**[00:35:36]** Q: Which isn’t an example.
K: Example doesn’t work.

**[00:35:41]** Example or influence –
all that becomes tawdry.

**[00:35:45]** Q: Not a silent example
of just being good and friendly.

**[00:35:47]** K: That doesn’t work at all.

**[00:35:52]** Q: Is this in a way
that they understand?

**[00:35:56]** There must be a profound effect –
in a way that somebody understands?

**[00:36:03]** Q: Mentally, you mean?

**[00:36:08]** K: You investigate, sir,
don’t ask me.

**[00:36:10]** Let’s investigate together.

**[00:36:14]** Q: I would say that there’s not
necessarily a mental understanding,

**[00:36:20]** in the first instance.

**[00:36:23]** Q: Do you mean conscious?
Q: Conscious.

**[00:36:26]** I would say
that comes later, possibly.

**[00:36:30]** Q: Because understanding
usually means

**[00:36:32]** a conscious recognition
of something.

**[00:36:34]** That’s why I didn’t quite understand
what you’re saying.

**[00:36:40]** Q: Sir, we did come,
I can’t remember which day…

**[00:36:46]** ...to say we approached the notion

**[00:36:48]** of sharing a perception
of something.

**[00:36:51]** One person sees something

**[00:36:54]** and in looking at it

**[00:36:56]** somehow, that perception was
communicated despite the words.

**[00:37:01]** K: Scott, forget what we have talked
about, totally forget altogether.

**[00:37:07]** Begin again.

**[00:37:11]** I want to tell you something.
I’ve talked to you a great deal.

**[00:37:17]** I even became the example, suppose,
all that, and yet that hasn’t…

**[00:37:23]** I haven’t really
communicated with you.

**[00:37:29]** Because communication means
both of us seeing the same thing

**[00:37:35]** at the same moment,

**[00:37:37]** feel the same thing
at the same level, and so on.

**[00:37:43]** Apparently, words, example, books,
that doesn’t touch that core.

**[00:37:54]** I want to find out by examining,
discussing, investigating,

**[00:38:00]** what is it that can be communicated
so that we meet at the same level,

**[00:38:08]** at the same time,
with the same intensity?

**[00:38:12]** I don’t know if I can convey
what I’m talking about.

**[00:38:17]** Q: From what you’ve just said
about the Benedictine monk...

**[00:38:20]** K: Forget him.

**[00:38:21]** Q: But what you mentioned was
that he was still anchored.

**[00:38:25]** So, until he pulls up his anchor
he can’t listen to that.

**[00:38:30]** K: No, forget what I said
about the Benedictine.

**[00:38:34]** Let’s start all over again.

**[00:38:37]** Q: Sir, just as you say that
and you asked that question,

**[00:38:47]** now there can be a communication
of your question

**[00:38:50]** which is perhaps beyond
the words in your question,

**[00:38:53]** about the need, the necessity
of meeting at the same place,

**[00:38:57]** at the same time, on the same issue.

**[00:38:59]** If that takes place...

**[00:39:01]** K: Go on, sir, investigate.
Don’t ask me – investigate.

**[00:39:06]** Q: I don’t know
how to investigate without asking.

**[00:39:10]** Q: Ask yourself.

**[00:39:14]** K: Sorry, go ahead.

**[00:39:16]** Q: We’re not really talking about
a communication between individuals.

**[00:39:21]** K: No, I’m not.

**[00:39:26]** I’ve tried that. I’ve tried
to communicate with my son

**[00:39:31]** and my son listens to me, likes me,

**[00:39:37]** somewhat has
an affection or respect,

**[00:39:40]** but the influence of other boys,
other society, is so strong

**[00:39:45]** that what I say has
very little meaning to him.

**[00:39:50]** But I want to get at him
at a deeper level. You follow?

**[00:39:58]** I want to have a contact at the
greatest depth possible with him.

**[00:40:05]** That may have some kind of effect
throughout his life.

**[00:40:10]** That’s my concern.

**[00:40:13]** So I talk to him, point out all this

**[00:40:16]** but he doesn’t pay much attention
to what I’m saying

**[00:40:20]** because the other
is much too strong.

**[00:40:24]** So, I realise I have to approach him
from a totally different angle.

**[00:40:34]** What is that communication which,
even though he’s unconscious of it,

**[00:40:42]** is working in him?
You understand what I mean?

**[00:40:45]** Now, what is that?
Let’s discuss.

**[00:40:48]** Q: Sir, at the beginning you did
mention the word ‘subconscious’.

**[00:40:54]** K: Yes, call it ‘deeper level’,
doesn’t matter.

**[00:40:58]** Q: I’m not quite sure
what you mean

**[00:41:00]** by communicating with someone
at a subconscious...

**[00:41:05]** K: Not subconscious
– at a deeper level, call it.

**[00:41:11]** Don’t you know
what I’m talking about?

**[00:41:14]** Q: I have an inkling of it, but...

**[00:41:17]** Q: It’s like planting a seed,
you’re thinking.

**[00:41:23]** Q: Isn’t that a communication
with love?

**[00:41:27]** Q: You’re sort of implying
that I’m totally unaware.

**[00:41:30]** K: Sir, don’t ask me.
Discuss it.

**[00:41:35]** Q: There is a saying,
‘where somebody is coming from’.

**[00:41:39]** Which does seem to me to indicate,
as I have observed it,

**[00:41:44]** something more
than their conditioning.

**[00:41:49]** I have observed somebody change
where they’re coming from

**[00:41:53]** and yet there is no real indication
of why they should have changed.

**[00:41:58]** There seems to be
some possible movement

**[00:42:02]** which changes
something deep in them,

**[00:42:06]** yet doesn’t come
from surface events.

**[00:42:12]** I don’t know if that has
anything to do with it.

**[00:42:14]** It’s an observation I’ve had.

**[00:42:16]** K: Is communication ever mechanical?

**[00:42:22]** You understand?

**[00:42:25]** At present, is our communication
with each other mechanical?

**[00:42:30]** Q: It can be with conditioning.
K: Apparently, it is.

**[00:42:34]** Because it doesn’t affect
a non-mechanistic mind.

**[00:42:47]** You’re not discussing with me.

**[00:42:53]** Q: If we’re discussing
communication,

**[00:42:54]** I want to communicate
something to someone else.

**[00:43:01]** With a communication of information,
there has to be content

**[00:43:06]** and I do the communicating.

**[00:43:08]** If we’re talking
about deeper levels,

**[00:43:11]** then we have to ask what sort
of content this communication has

**[00:43:18]** and what sort of communication
it could possibly be.

**[00:43:24]** Normal communication involves
I say something to someone else

**[00:43:28]** – it emanates from a source
and goes to a receiver.

**[00:43:35]** If it’s me wanting
to communicate to someone else

**[00:43:40]** – this hypothetical son
doesn’t listen –

**[00:43:44]** and I want him to listen,

**[00:43:45]** I’m trying impose my will upon him.

**[00:43:50]** If this deeper level
works in quite a different way,

**[00:43:55]** then it may not have
the element of will or content,

**[00:44:03]** and it seems difficult to see how
it could have the element of ‘I’.

**[00:44:07]** Q: A little louder, please.

**[00:44:09]** It’s difficult to hear
from this side.

**[00:44:11]** Q: Oh, I’ve just finished.

**[00:44:14]** Q: If there is a content,
I think there is a motive.

**[00:44:20]** But what I’m thinking
of doing with this child

**[00:44:24]** is to just establish
a deeper link

**[00:44:27]** and then whatever
communication there is

**[00:44:30]** would probably go
through the linkage automatically.

**[00:44:35]** Q: How do you know
how to establish a deeper link?

**[00:44:38]** Q: And what’s going
to flow along the linkage?

**[00:44:41]** Q: Whatever is spontaneously
necessary to be communicated,

**[00:44:46]** whatever you feel.

**[00:44:49]** Q: If you feel that you want
to do the communication,

**[00:44:51]** it’s not spontaneous.

**[00:44:52]** Q: If I really strongly feel

**[00:44:56]** and have the necessity
to reach the person,

**[00:45:01]** it would happen.

**[00:45:03]** It’s not a belief of some kind,
it’s just a feeling.

**[00:45:10]** Q: This is a sort of condition where
telepathic communication occurs,

**[00:45:14]** but we’re not, apparently…

**[00:45:17]** Q: I don’t know what telepathy is.

**[00:45:20]** Q: Just what we’ve
been talking about.

**[00:45:24]** Q: We’ve got a bit off the track,

**[00:45:28]** but I wonder if we could go back
to what you said about content.

**[00:45:37]** When we’re communicating
in an ordinary way,

**[00:45:42]** there’s always a content

**[00:45:45]** and there’s also the ‘I’
that is conveying the content.

**[00:45:48]** I think there may be a clue in that.

**[00:45:54]** I don’t know.
K: Go ahead.

**[00:45:56]** Q: I feel there was something in it.
I’m just trying to grasp it.

**[00:46:00]** I wonder if we can
go into it, a little bit.

**[00:46:09]** K: Louder, sir, they can’t hear.

**[00:46:12]** Q: Has charisma anything
to do with it?

**[00:46:14]** It is different from charisma,

**[00:46:16]** but charisma also
is a form of communication.

**[00:46:20]** In what way is this different?

**[00:46:24]** Q: Charisma is a dangerous thing.
Q: Yes, it is.

**[00:46:28]** I feel this is different.

**[00:46:30]** Q: All the gurus have this charisma
and they’re misleading people.

**[00:46:34]** It’s not that.

**[00:46:36]** Q: We don’t know
what it is, do we?

**[00:46:38]** We’re talking about a possible
communication at a deeper level,

**[00:46:42]** and since we don’t know
what this is,

**[00:46:44]** it’s rather difficult to define it.

**[00:46:46]** Q: But I think we do know,
actually, don’t we?

**[00:46:48]** Sometimes somebody
said something to us

**[00:46:51]** and we’ve instantly got what
they’re saying at a deeper level,

**[00:46:54]** without thinking about it very much.
It’s quickly taken up,

**[00:46:59]** and I’m wondering
if that’s the sort of thing

**[00:47:03]** that one has to talk to, when we’re
involved in this sort of discussion.

**[00:47:06]** Q: Then they’d have
definite content.

**[00:47:08]** Is that’s what we’re discussing?

**[00:47:09]** It thought it wasn’t.
Q: Yes, it would have content then.

**[00:47:12]** This would be a sort of
understanding, wouldn’t it?

**[00:47:14]** You can have conversions
to different points of view.

**[00:47:18]** I was converted to CND
by somebody explaining it

**[00:47:22]** and suddenly I saw the thing from
a completely different point of view

**[00:47:25]** and became a supporter
of the CND movement.

**[00:47:29]** But that was still a thing with
concepts in normal communication.

**[00:47:35]** The fact that I was converted to CND

**[00:47:38]** hasn’t abolished nuclear weapons.

**[00:47:44]** Q: To communicate and to be able
to actually meet a person

**[00:47:51]** one needs to meet that person
with the same intensity.

**[00:47:55]** It seems that one of the things
that’s missing is the intensity.

**[00:48:00]** If there’s a lack of intensity,

**[00:48:02]** obviously, there is
no communication.

**[00:48:05]** In other words, it’s being seen
as communication on two levels

**[00:48:09]** and therefore, there is
no communication as such.

**[00:48:13]** We’ve gone round and round,
and come to the brink several times.

**[00:48:21]** We’ve explored that communication,
being able to see a thing clearly,

**[00:48:29]** that words and the usual forms
do not bring about the space

**[00:48:37]** that’s necessary for a change
to come about in us.

**[00:48:42]** It seems that we retreat each time.

**[00:48:49]** Can we explore this point
where we retreat

**[00:48:52]** instead of just remaining
with the situation

**[00:48:55]** where we can see we cannot go
any further one way or the other?

**[00:49:00]** Because nothing ever gets resolved,
it’s just repeat and repeat.

**[00:49:06]** Q: Could we investigate
if there’s a form of communication

**[00:49:12]** which paradoxically has nothing
to do with communication,

**[00:49:17]** as we know it?
K: Yes, sir.

**[00:49:33]** I’ve heard in India and in Europe
a group of people praying for peace

**[00:49:47]** – the Christian nuns and monks
and special groups,

**[00:49:54]** pray from morning till night.

**[00:49:58]** I’m not saying it’s right or wrong,
I’m just looking at it.

**[00:50:06]** People have hoped
through that there will be peace,

**[00:50:12]** otherwise they wouldn’t pray.

**[00:50:19]** Is that an indication – I’m just
asking, I’m not saying it is –

**[00:50:30]** that a state of mind

**[00:50:36]** which is capable of meeting…

**[00:50:40]** I’m lost.

**[00:50:43]** No, I’m not,
I know what I want to say.

**[00:50:53]** Let us look at it this way,
for a moment.

**[00:50:58]** There have been
good people in the world,

**[00:51:04]** and in the air, as it were,
there is a reservoir of goodness.

**[00:51:12]** And also there is a reservoir
of that which is terribly evil

**[00:51:17]** – we’ll use the word ‘evil’
just to convey – unrelated.

**[00:51:23]** Good is not the outcome of evil,

**[00:51:25]** there are two separate activities
in human beings.

**[00:51:30]** There have been a tremendous
lot of people in the world

**[00:51:34]** who have said, ‘Let’s be good,
talk about goodness.

**[00:51:37]** Let’s write about it.

**[00:51:38]** Let’s think about it.
Let’s try to live it’.

**[00:51:41]** There is another group – terrorists,
the evil. It exists in the air.

**[00:51:49]** Right?
Must exist in the air.

**[00:51:54]** After these million years

**[00:51:56]** – like the television,
what do you call it?

**[00:52:03]** Q: Waves.

**[00:52:14]** K: Now, this thing which is called
evil is predominating now.

**[00:52:20]** Right?

**[00:52:22]** I’m just examining, sir,
don’t accept it.

**[00:52:26]** This is dominating the world

**[00:52:29]** – atom bomb, terrorists,
national divisions,

**[00:52:33]** the crazy things that are
going on in this world.

**[00:52:38]** The other is not in opposition
but it is also working on its own.

**[00:52:47]** And that seems to have very
little effect on this, apparently.

**[00:52:54]** Right?

**[00:52:56]** Are we together so far?
I want to examine this a little bit.

**[00:53:00]** Q: Perhaps even
a diminishing effect.

**[00:53:02]** Perhaps, there’s
a polarisation of the two.

**[00:53:06]** K: Synthesis of the two?
Q: No, a polarisation of the two.

**[00:53:08]** K: What do you mean by that word?

**[00:53:11]** Q: That the good is affecting the
evil less and less, and vice versa.

**[00:53:14]** K: That’s right.
That’s what I’m saying.

**[00:53:16]** The good is affecting
less and less the other.

**[00:53:23]** How do I make that thing
which is good all-enveloping?

**[00:53:32]** You follow my question?

**[00:53:42]** I’ve done prayers, I’ve worshipped,
I have done all kinds of things

**[00:53:49]** in order to resist the other,

**[00:53:55]** but the other is getting
more and more dominant,

**[00:53:57]** more and more powerful,

**[00:54:00]** and the other is getting
less and less.

**[00:54:05]** Apparently, that’s… don’t discuss
the ratio and all the rest of it.

**[00:54:17]** Can that goodness communicate

**[00:54:20]** to the people
who are indulging in the evil?

**[00:54:28]** You understand
what I’m talking about?

**[00:54:32]** Q: Why doesn’t it communicate now?

**[00:54:36]** Why does not the good
communicate with the evil, now?

**[00:54:39]** K: Perhaps it is.

**[00:54:45]** After all, you are very good.
Suppose you are very good

**[00:54:49]** in the highest sense of that word.
And I’m not.

**[00:54:55]** I belong to the other camp.

**[00:55:05]** Your very being good
is somehow affecting me

**[00:55:10]** though I may not know it.

**[00:55:13]** It is not some
mysterious process,

**[00:55:18]** it is a chemical process.
You follow?

**[00:55:24]** It’s like fresh air and
air that has been polluted.

**[00:55:31]** The fresh air is always coming in,
but I’m always polluting it.

**[00:55:39]** So, how do you help?

**[00:55:45]** No, how do you see that your air
remains pure wherever I am?

**[00:55:52]** Am I conveying something?
Q: Yes.

**[00:55:58]** Q: Are we talking
about communication

**[00:56:01]** which is not intentional?
It seems to be the missing word.

**[00:56:04]** I can conceive of communication

**[00:56:06]** which is not intentional
communication.

**[00:56:09]** I find it very difficult
to understand communication

**[00:56:11]** which has nothing to do
with communication.

**[00:56:13]** It doesn’t seem to be saying
anything worth saying.

**[00:56:18]** But there are maybe forms which
are not intended to communicate,

**[00:56:22]** which nevertheless do.

**[00:56:30]** K: Suppose there’s a body of people
who don’t belong to any religion,

**[00:56:36]** no faith, no nationality,

**[00:56:42]** who in themselves have completely
abandoned any form of violence,

**[00:56:51]** which means no fear and so on.

**[00:56:53]** If there were such a group of people

**[00:56:56]** here, on earth
– not in heaven, here –

**[00:57:01]** they would have
tremendous effect.

**[00:57:07]** Not the effect through a media
– you follow what I mean?

**[00:57:16]** There is a communication
which is not through cause,

**[00:57:22]** institutions
and all the rest of it.

**[00:57:27]** Q: Through a change of state
in the environment communicates.

**[00:57:38]** It’s probably simpler than that,
they haven’t set up any machinery…

**[00:57:45]** Q: Are you saying that it isn’t
communication in the active sense

**[00:57:50]** of something being given out
towards something,

**[00:57:54]** but simply the fact of its being?

**[00:57:57]** K: That’s all. I’m saying that.
Yes, that’s right.

**[00:58:03]** Q: Is it to do with the clarity
of the person from whom it comes?

**[00:58:22]** Q: Is there anything more,
Krishnaji,

**[00:58:25]** that you can say about this?

**[00:58:27]** K: Not ‘I can say’
– we are talking together.

**[00:58:36]** Q: I was going to say,
in this idea of the group of people,

**[00:58:41]** is this ‘whatever happens’
dependent on the size of the group?

**[00:58:46]** Would one person
be as good as ten

**[00:58:49]** or ten people be as good
as twenty or a hundred?

**[00:58:52]** What is the role of a group

**[00:58:53]** as opposed to a single person
in this process?

**[00:58:57]** K: Don’t let’s even call it a group.
A number of people.

**[00:59:01]** I don’t know how to put it.
Q: To eliminate the quantitative?

**[00:59:05]** K: That’s right.
Q: Could it be just one person?

**[00:59:08]** K: Yes, sir. Suppose you are
– not suppose, you may be,

**[00:59:14]** you have no nationality,
no identification with any sect,

**[00:59:19]** any religion,

**[00:59:21]** and you are free of fear and so on –

**[00:59:24]** you are an extraordinary person.

**[00:59:32]** By your very existence, you are
communicating something to me,

**[00:59:39]** which is non-verbal.

**[00:59:42]** Q: I have no problem accepting it.

**[00:59:51]** K: It’s not a question
of accepting it.

**[00:59:54]** It’s a question of
whether we are such people.

**[00:59:59]** Q: You communicate this
by the very fact of it,

**[01:00:03]** but this other thing is so strong,
as you put it, with the son.

**[01:00:08]** So, what happens
to the communication?

**[01:00:10]** Q: But does there need to be
a critical mass to these people?

**[01:00:15]** We can’t avoid
quantitative thoughts.

**[01:00:17]** Maybe ten of these people are
ten times more powerful than one.

**[01:00:22]** If there’s enough,

**[01:00:23]** maybe there’s potential
for something very positive.

**[01:00:28]** Q: We were eliminating the
quantitative element, weren’t we?

**[01:00:31]** Q: Yes, but maybe you can’t.

**[01:00:35]** Because maybe you need
lots of these people

**[01:00:39]** to effect this balance of good
and evil that we’re talking about.

**[01:00:42]** Q: I think we’ve moved
into something else now

**[01:00:45]** because it’s changed
the whole question somewhat.

**[01:00:49]** Q: This is not really an academic
question that we’re discussing,

**[01:00:52]** it’s a question of whether
we can look into this right now.

**[01:00:57]** Q: I don’t think the word ‘academic’
means much in these circumstances.

**[01:00:59]** Q: We’re not discussing

**[01:01:02]** what might happen
if twenty or a hundred people.

**[01:01:05]** We’re discussing now

**[01:01:07]** whether it’s possible for us,
this group now,

**[01:01:10]** to have this communication.

**[01:01:14]** Numbers is really irrelevant.

**[01:01:18]** Q: I wouldn’t accept
the numbers are totally irrelevant.

**[01:01:25]** Q: If there’s a balance of power,

**[01:01:27]** good and evil
like Russia and America

**[01:01:30]** – then it would be
a numerical thing.

**[01:01:33]** If you could jump up
to another state

**[01:01:36]** where you were no longer
talking about this balance of power,

**[01:01:39]** not in terms of just hydrogen bombs,

**[01:01:42]** but if somebody had a superbomb

**[01:01:44]** which could blow up
the entire universe,

**[01:01:48]** then we’d be talking
about a different thing.

**[01:01:52]** Then it might no longer
have this quantitative element

**[01:01:55]** – if one of these superbombs
could blow up the entire universe,

**[01:02:00]** then the whole question about
the balance of power, good and evil

**[01:02:04]** just disappears.

**[01:02:12]** But it hasn’t happened yet,

**[01:02:14]** otherwise we wouldn’t be here
discussing it.

**[01:02:28]** Q: Sir, you’ve asked us
to look at this communication.

**[01:02:32]** K: Discuss it.

**[01:02:34]** Q: It seems so elusive, so difficult
to get any perspective on,

**[01:02:42]** I don’t know how we can discuss it.
I don’t know if we can.

**[01:02:50]** Even asking how does one meet
at the same place at the same time,

**[01:02:54]** with the same intensity,

**[01:02:55]** seems something which is beyond
what we are capable of discussing.

**[01:03:01]** Q: I understood that
we are doing this, more or less,

**[01:03:08]** that it is a process going on.

**[01:03:13]** K: Not quite, sir, not quite.

**[01:03:15]** but go ahead,
let’s talk about it.

**[01:03:19]** Q: The difficulty is that
if we approach it as individuals,

**[01:03:21]** we get absolutely stopped,

**[01:03:23]** but if we’re not individuals

**[01:03:26]** there is this communion
or whatever, that’s here.

**[01:03:31]** But we constantly destroy it
or ignore it or lose it

**[01:03:34]** because we are thinking
of ourselves as individuals.

**[01:03:38]** Then we start asking, ‘How can
we communicate with each other?’

**[01:03:42]** K: Sir, is it a problem to you,

**[01:03:47]** not being able to do anything about
all these terrible things going on?

**[01:03:53]** A problem, like hunger is a problem
if you have no food?

**[01:03:59]** Is it an acute problem with you?

**[01:04:02]** Or you say,
’Let’s talk about the atomic bomb’?

**[01:04:08]** Q: It’s a problem.
K: Is it an acute problem to you

**[01:04:14]** that Russia is spreading
like wildfire?

**[01:04:21]** You know all that,
I don’t have to describe it.

**[01:04:25]** I feel it is a tremendous problem,
a very complex problem,

**[01:04:32]** so I have to do
something about it.

**[01:04:38]** And I cannot go and demonstrate
– that’s too silly –

**[01:04:43]** or join a group
or form an organisation.

**[01:04:50]** It seems so utterly infantile,
in front of this enormous problem.

**[01:05:00]** That’s what I feel,
it’s infantile all this,

**[01:05:05]** immature,
whatever word you like to use.

**[01:05:07]** So, what am I to do?

**[01:05:21]** If it is an acute problem
with all of us,

**[01:05:25]** then what happens?
That’s what I want to get at.

**[01:05:32]** Not intellectual problem
or emotional or sentimental

**[01:05:35]** – ‘Don’t do this,
don’t think about the Russians

**[01:05:38]** because then they’ll become
more aggressive’.

**[01:05:42]** They are aggressive.
You can’t make them more.

**[01:05:49]** So, what am I to do confronted
with this enormous problem?

**[01:06:00]** Either I run away
into some Himalayan retreat.

**[01:06:07]** I can’t do that

**[01:06:12]** because I have a son, a daughter,
I’ve got people around.

**[01:06:20]** What am I to do? Come on, sir,
let’s talk about it.

**[01:06:35]** Q: Sir, you ask a question like that
and one feels stumped.

**[01:06:42]** K: No, I’m not stumped.

**[01:06:48]** I’m asking,
is it an acute problem with us?

**[01:06:55]** As it is for those people
who are living in Poland now,

**[01:07:01]** or in Romania or in Hungary,
who say, ‘My God!’

**[01:07:08]** There was a letter from a person
living in Eastern Europe

**[01:07:16]** to this famous author
whom I used to know.

**[01:07:20]** He said, ‘Don’t talk about peace,
for God’s sake.

**[01:07:25]** Advocate war,
because only then we shall be free’.

**[01:07:31]** You follow?

**[01:07:33]** It was a tremendous,
burning problem to them,

**[01:07:38]** to be trodden down.

**[01:07:43]** So, if I feel
this is a tremendous problem

**[01:07:48]** and I know I can’t resolve it

**[01:07:53]** – I can’t change Mrs Thatcher or
Mr Mitterrand or Mr Reagan’s mind.

**[01:08:00]** I can’t.

**[01:08:03]** Even Brezhnev!

**[01:08:08]** So, what am I to do?

**[01:08:16]** I can’t go to the Pope and say,
‘For God’s sake,

**[01:08:19]** excommunicate everyone
who takes part in it’.

**[01:08:26]** That’ll be the end of the Church.

**[01:08:30]** So, they won’t listen.

**[01:08:34]** None of them will listen.
So, what am I to do?

**[01:08:54]** Q: One thing is to make sure one
doesn’t contribute to this oneself.

**[01:08:59]** K: I am.

**[01:09:02]** By paying tax,
I’m supporting this.

**[01:09:10]** By buying a stamp,
something goes out of it.

**[01:09:17]** Q: I don’t mean physically,
I mean mentally,

**[01:09:24]** how, in oneself, lives one’s life
so that it doesn’t contribute.

**[01:09:30]** K: May I ask,
is it an acute problem with us?

**[01:09:47]** Q: It isn’t acute to most of us,
I would assume.

**[01:09:53]** K: No, that’s right.

**[01:09:56]** Therefore, we let Reagan,
Mrs Thatcher, Brezhnev run us.

**[01:10:02]** We are slaves to them.

**[01:10:04]** Sorry, I hope I’m not...

**[01:10:08]** Mrs Thatcher won’t put me in prison.

**[01:10:26]** Suppose it’s an acute,
burning problem with me

**[01:10:32]** and I know I cannot do a thing
to alter these people’s minds,

**[01:10:41]** what happens in that realisation?

**[01:11:32]** Q: In my case, the hope arises

**[01:11:35]** that some other path is possible,
totally unlike all these.

**[01:11:39]** It generates a quite
unreasonable feeling of hope.

**[01:11:45]** K: I don’t quite follow.

**[01:11:47]** Q: If one feels blocked in all
possible normal ways of acting…

**[01:11:52]** K: I am blocked.
Q: Yes.

**[01:11:56]** Because this feeling
of being blocked is intolerable

**[01:12:01]** and because if one really does feel
it is a problem,

**[01:12:04]** one can’t just sort of
forget about it

**[01:12:06]** and get on with something else…

**[01:12:08]** K: No, I can’t get on
with something else.

**[01:12:13]** Q: In that condition,
the only hope is

**[01:12:18]** a vertical take-off
into some other state.

**[01:12:23]** K: That’s what happens, sir.
That’s what actually takes place

**[01:12:27]** when I realise I cannot do anything

**[01:12:29]** to alter the course
of these leaders.

**[01:12:37]** Q: He said that there would be
a vertical take-off.

**[01:12:41]** K: Does it happen?

**[01:12:47]** Or do I turn my back on it all,
which is meaningless?

**[01:12:55]** Or the very realisation
that I can’t do anything

**[01:13:03]** has brought about
a totally different élan.

**[01:13:14]** A totally different kind of energy

**[01:13:16]** which is not
the energy of causation.

**[01:13:21]** I don’t know if I’m…

**[01:13:33]** Q: You mean realising this
doesn’t lead me to despair.

**[01:13:42]** K: I’m neither optimistic
or pessimistic, despair, hope

**[01:13:45]** – that’s all finished long ago.

**[01:13:49]** Q: Usually, when we look at all this
and realise that we have no power,

**[01:13:59]** we feel dismayed.

**[01:14:04]** K: No, when we realise we have no
power, we become indifferent.

**[01:14:11]** Q: Isn’t it partly because we see
the situation individualistically?

**[01:14:21]** Q: When you’ve really got
this problem and you’re stuck,

**[01:14:24]** you can’t hope or despair.

**[01:14:26]** That’s too much energy and activity.

**[01:14:29]** All that movement of thought and
feeling – there’s no room for them.

**[01:14:34]** Hope or despair about what might
happen are absolutely academic.

**[01:14:39]** Q: But we all seem to come to this
point where a jump has to be made,

**[01:14:48]** a vertical take-off,
if you like.

**[01:14:50]** K: The very confrontation
brings action.

**[01:14:56]** Not we have to make a jump.

**[01:14:58]** This is a tremendous problem

**[01:15:05]** and I can’t solve it.

**[01:15:09]** Q: Sometimes I think
maybe I’m in an illusion.

**[01:15:12]** K: Oh, no.
Q: I don’t mean to be offensive.

**[01:15:15]** K: In Afghanistan, they are killing
each other by the thousands.

**[01:15:20]** In Beirut.

**[01:15:25]** The concentration camps in Russia.
Q: Yes, I am aware of that truly,

**[01:15:30]** but something seems to be lacking.

**[01:15:35]** K: Is it that it’s not
a problem to us?

**[01:15:38]** That we don’t feel responsible
for all this? I do.

**[01:15:43]** As a human being,
my grandfathers, everybody,

**[01:15:47]** has contributed to all this

**[01:15:53]** and I see I am contributing
by buying a stamp.

**[01:16:00]** So, mustn’t I buy a stamp,
not travel?

**[01:16:05]** No, look at it, sir, look at it!

**[01:16:10]** Gradually, I drive myself
into a corner. I can’t move then.

**[01:16:20]** By turning on the electricity,
petrol – the whole of it.

**[01:16:33]** To say, ‘I won’t be responsible’,
it’s meaningless.

**[01:16:43]** So, I have to say,
‘Now I’ve come to a point

**[01:16:48]** that whatever I do,
is contributing to this horror.

**[01:16:56]** Whatever I do’.

**[01:16:59]** Q: Would it be that we feel partly
responsible in our small field?

**[01:17:07]** You seem to say
that we are totally responsible.

**[01:17:09]** K: Of course,
I’m totally responsible.

**[01:17:11]** We’re all totally responsible.

**[01:17:13]** Q: Normally, we feel partly
responsible in a small field.

**[01:17:20]** K: I am totally responsible,
as long as I’m a nationalist,

**[01:17:25]** as I recognise a country, a belief,
all the rest of the business.

**[01:17:33]** It’s only when I am totally
not responsible, I am out of it.

**[01:17:43]** Q: It’s because I feel
totally responsible for it

**[01:17:47]** that I think it’s not enough
just to talk about it.

**[01:17:52]** I feel I have to do something else.
K: No. No.

**[01:17:56]** It’s not something else
I have to do.

**[01:18:00]** Sir, confronted
with an enormous problem

**[01:18:06]** you become silent, don’t you?

**[01:18:10]** Q: Sometimes.

**[01:18:12]** K: No, you are not.
You are talking about it.

**[01:18:21]** I cannot solve this,

**[01:18:25]** as a human being

**[01:18:31]** who is the rest of mankind.

**[01:18:34]** Mankind has brought
this situation about.

**[01:18:38]** Not Mr Einstein only,

**[01:18:41]** all Einsteins in the world
have contributed to this.

**[01:18:50]** My fathers, my grandfathers,
my great-grandfathers,

**[01:18:53]** past ten generations
have contributed to this.

**[01:19:01]** And confronted with it,
I feel I’m incapable.

**[01:19:06]** I cannot solve it.

**[01:19:08]** But I’m not going to run away.

**[01:19:21]** You’re missing the point

**[01:19:22]** – what takes place
when you’re in that position?

**[01:19:30]** Q: When there’s something deeper

**[01:19:32]** than my thinking self
feeling affronted

**[01:19:35]** which will cause me
to stop and look.

**[01:19:41]** K: Sir, take a totally
different thing.

**[01:19:47]** Human beings have suffered

**[01:19:50]** for thousands
and thousands of years.

**[01:19:56]** Think of all the men and women
who have been slaughtered,

**[01:20:00]** who have shed tears, maimed,
wounded, no arms, no legs, all that.

**[01:20:09]** There is this immense sorrow.

**[01:20:14]** And confronted with it,
I can’t do anything about it.

**[01:20:26]** So, the fact, the realisation comes,

**[01:20:30]** as long as you are belonging to that
you’re contributing to it.

**[01:20:35]** That’s all.

**[01:20:48]** Q: Does this also bring us back
to the point we were discussing

**[01:20:55]** that maybe if we feel intensely
about something

**[01:20:58]** that this releases energies which
are able to communicate to others?

**[01:21:03]** This seemed to be where we got to

**[01:21:05]** and we seemed
to abandoned that point,

**[01:21:08]** and that seemed
to be very important

**[01:21:10]** because this was leading
towards an alternative strategy

**[01:21:16]** for looking at these problems.

**[01:21:30]** Q: I don’t see how we can ask
any questions at this point,

**[01:21:33]** least of all of Krishnaji.

**[01:21:38]** K: That’s what I’m saying,

**[01:21:40]** we are never silent
to face the problem.

**[01:21:47]** That silence answers the problem.

**[01:21:52]** I don’t know
what I’m saying – right?

**[01:21:56]** I’m not stupidly silent.

**[01:22:02]** I don’t say, ‘I must be silent
to understand the problem’,

**[01:22:06]** that’s too infantile.

**[01:22:09]** But the very problem
makes me silent.

**[01:22:21]** And I’m naturally a silent person,
therefore it goes through my...

**[01:22:51]** Therefore, when you ask me,
how do you answer this problem

**[01:22:57]** of aggression by Russia
or by any country’,

**[01:23:03]** I say, ‘Don’t answer it’.

**[01:23:09]** If I answer it, my answer will be
according to my conditioning.

**[01:23:16]** But if I’m not conditioned, my
answer will be entirely different.

**[01:23:23]** So, my concern is to free myself
from all this blasted nonsense.

**[01:23:29]** Q: Which takes up all our energy,
most of the time.

**[01:23:43]** K: I don’t know if you heard
last night – what’s his name?

**[01:23:50]** Tony Benn on one side,
on the other, Healey.

**[01:23:54]** Healey tells Mr Tony Benn, ‘You are
telling a lie and you know you are’.

**[01:24:01]** And nobody challenges it.
You follow?

**[01:24:05]** They accept it.

**[01:24:30]** Is it that we haven’t got humility?

**[01:24:35]** This is not to be cultivated

**[01:24:37]** – real humility,
in front of something enormous.

**[01:25:32]** Q: You seem to be telling us
that we should take ourselves away

**[01:25:36]** from a society
that supports these evils.

**[01:25:39]** Is that a practical proposition?

**[01:25:55]** Q: Do you mean also, sir,
that we cannot be partially good?

**[01:26:00]** K: It’s like a partially bad egg.

**[01:26:17]** Do you remember that lovely story?

**[01:26:25]** A husband is taking his wife
to the hospital

**[01:26:28]** because she’s just in labour.

**[01:26:31]** And as they enter the hospital,
he says,

**[01:26:35]** ‘Darling, do you really want
to go through with this?’

**[01:27:15]** Q: So, is education
helping the child or everybody

**[01:27:20]** to step out of this mess?

**[01:27:26]** Not to be accustomed,
not to find his way in the mess

**[01:27:32]** but to step out of it.

**[01:27:35]** K: To realise you can’t do anything
in front of this utter confusion

**[01:27:42]** requires a great deal
of intelligence.

**[01:28:15]** I’m glad we all met.
I hope we shall meet again.
