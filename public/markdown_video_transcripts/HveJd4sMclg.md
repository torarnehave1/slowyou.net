**[00:00:21]** Krishnamurti: Shall we go on

**[00:00:22]** with our conversation
about education still?

**[00:00:31]** Yes or no?
Questioner: Yes.

**[00:00:44]** K: As far as one can see,

**[00:00:48]** the politicians have not been
able to solve any problems.

**[00:00:52]** On the contrary,
they are increasing more.

**[00:00:57]** Nor the scientists.

**[00:01:00]** They are creating the atom bomb

**[00:01:05]** and the counter-atom bombs
and so on, so on.

**[00:01:10]** Nor the economists.

**[00:01:15]** Nor the social reformers.

**[00:01:22]** So, what shall we do?

**[00:01:29]** One sees the necessity
of a new society,

**[00:01:34]** a new relationship between
human beings, which is society,

**[00:01:44]** and we apparently,
ordinary people like us,

**[00:01:51]** we don’t seem to change at all.

**[00:01:55]** We change slightly here and there,
but not fundamentally.

**[00:02:03]** And the world is going to rot,

**[00:02:07]** disintegrating,

**[00:02:11]** and we seem to be utterly helpless.

**[00:02:18]** And we have children who are
going to be a future generation,

**[00:02:31]** and they too seem
to follow our pattern.

**[00:02:38]** So, what does education mean?

**[00:02:41]** Not only the education
of our children, but ourselves

**[00:02:50]** – what is the whole
human life becoming?

**[00:02:56]** Where is it all ending up?

**[00:02:59]** Should we discuss that a little?

**[00:03:10]** Silence, or is it general approval?

**[00:03:22]** Q: The trouble seems to be, partly,
that we have so many problems.

**[00:03:33]** We have the problem of our child,
the problem of our wife or husband,

**[00:03:39]** we have the problem
of earning a livelihood,

**[00:03:41]** the problem of our job
and how to keep it

**[00:03:46]** – so many problems confront us.
K: So, what?

**[00:03:48]** Q: We don’t know how to consummate
our energies in the essential,

**[00:03:53]** or indeed, what is the essential.

**[00:03:55]** K: Yes. We don’t seem to be able
to solve our own problems.

**[00:04:02]** We’re probably heaping our problems
on to our children.

**[00:04:06]** So, where do we start with all this?

**[00:04:12]** Surely we can’t depend
on politicians any more,

**[00:04:16]** including Mrs Thatcher,

**[00:04:20]** nor any of the scientists.

**[00:04:31]** So, it behoves us
to start with ourselves.

**[00:04:34]** Surely, that’s the only thing to do.

**[00:04:41]** Can we educate ourselves,

**[00:04:48]** not allowing time
as a factor to change,

**[00:04:54]** to bring about a transformation,
a mutation of our whole behaviour?

**[00:05:11]** Q: But is there any reason
to assume that

**[00:05:14]** we can improve the world
through education?

**[00:05:16]** The past history of the world

**[00:05:20]** gives reason for thinking
that individuals can change,

**[00:05:24]** but not much hope for thinking that
entire societies can be transformed.

**[00:05:29]** Are we pursuing a chimera,

**[00:05:33]** attempting to change the world
through education?

**[00:05:39]** K: Please, discuss it.

**[00:05:41]** Q: It was once remarked that Germany
before the Second World War

**[00:05:50]** was the most educated country
in the world.

**[00:05:56]** Clearly, it depends
what one means by education.

**[00:06:05]** Q: Education of any kind
that’s ever existed in the world

**[00:06:09]** has not, as far as we know,
succeeded

**[00:06:11]** in making any particular country

**[00:06:15]** like paradise in terms
of the way people behave.

**[00:06:18]** Some have been better than others,

**[00:06:21]** but is there any reason to believe
in the perfectibility of mankind?

**[00:06:28]** K: Sir, is mankind
different from you and me?

**[00:06:33]** Q: Yes.
K: In what way?

**[00:06:38]** Q: When you have a collective,
there seem to be laws

**[00:06:42]** and factors of collective psychology

**[00:06:44]** different from
individual psychology.

**[00:06:48]** Psychology of mobs is different from
individuals that make up the mob.

**[00:06:53]** So, there seem to be general rules
of collective psychology

**[00:06:57]** that mean that somehow
the collective

**[00:07:00]** is different from the individuals.

**[00:07:02]** K: Is the collective different
psychologically, from us?

**[00:07:08]** Q: Yes, I think so.
K: In what way?

**[00:07:14]** Q: The collective, a society
contains a lot of social rules.

**[00:07:20]** A society has rules,

**[00:07:21]** all societies have rules
and patterns of behaviour.

**[00:07:25]** We are parts of society.

**[00:07:27]** The relation between individuals
and the societies,

**[00:07:33]** it’s like the relation
between cells and the body.

**[00:07:38]** The body is more
than the individual cells

**[00:07:40]** and society is more
than the individual members of it.

**[00:07:43]** It has rules,
within which the members interact.

**[00:07:49]** I think that there’s a distinct
difference between human societies

**[00:07:54]** and the individuals
that make them up.

**[00:07:56]** The whole is more
than the sum of its parts.

**[00:08:01]** Although, of course,
the parts are related to the whole.

**[00:08:08]** Q: But is my greed fundamentally
different from the collective greed?

**[00:08:13]** Q: Yes.
Q: In what way?

**[00:08:17]** Q: I think collective greed
is more likely to be a reflection

**[00:08:25]** of individual greed than war,
as we were discussing last night,

**[00:08:31]** but on the whole,
people within societies

**[00:08:37]** don’t behave aggressively
to other members,

**[00:08:41]** but societies as a whole

**[00:08:43]** often behave aggressively
to other societies.

**[00:08:46]** It’s rare for ordinary, decent
Englishmen to kill other Englishmen,

**[00:08:51]** but it’s very common in the last
two wars for them to kill Germans

**[00:08:54]** or other people
who the country declared war on.

**[00:08:57]** And this was a sort of social…

**[00:08:59]** or a projection
of individual things,

**[00:09:01]** but it’s not something
that happens within.

**[00:09:04]** The society, as a whole,
seems to have a dynamic

**[00:09:07]** which is not just that
of the individuals within it.

**[00:09:10]** But I think this is a phenomenon
that happens all through nature

**[00:09:15]** – collectives take on
laws and properties

**[00:09:18]** which are not simply those
of the parts that make them up.

**[00:09:23]** K: Is a collective an abstraction?

**[00:09:27]** Q: No, I don’t think a country
is an abstraction, or a society.

**[00:09:32]** It’s certainly a word, but I think
societies have their own…

**[00:09:36]** anthropologists can study
the customs of different societies…

**[00:09:42]** K: Yes, is the individual
also an abstraction?

**[00:09:47]** Q: I don’t think so.

**[00:09:50]** Q: Then we have to distinguish
between form and essence.

**[00:09:57]** We’ve put together

**[00:09:58]** a certain way of behaving,
a certain way of dressing

**[00:10:01]** which is temporary and a fabrication
which we group.

**[00:10:05]** In essence, maybe we’re the same.

**[00:10:09]** Similarly, with the individual,

**[00:10:11]** we transfer things
to the collective.

**[00:10:14]** That manifests what we are inside.

**[00:10:18]** But together, we obey rules
with a fabricated system.

**[00:10:25]** Q: Look, if we try to bring it back
just to this room,

**[00:10:29]** can’t we see here is
a group of people in a collective

**[00:10:31]** demonstrating all the ways
in which we as individuals

**[00:10:34]** privately avoid the central
challenge and the essential point?

**[00:10:41]** Are we really discussing
this matter as a collective

**[00:10:44]** differently from the way in which we
as individuals consider this matter?

**[00:10:49]** Aren’t we continually going about it

**[00:10:51]** to ensure that we remain in
the same situation, day after day?

**[00:10:56]** It may seem different,
we’re talking together,

**[00:10:59]** but it seems that really
we’re just putting out in the open

**[00:11:02]** the way in which we ourselves

**[00:11:04]** continue to remain
as separate individuals,

**[00:11:07]** with the collective as another idea.

**[00:11:11]** Q: Would you say that

**[00:11:13]** that’s what we’re pointing out
in the discussions?

**[00:11:15]** Basically, that’s what education is,
the knowledge we’ve talked about,

**[00:11:22]** how we feel about the collective
mind and the individual,

**[00:11:26]** that’s part of education,

**[00:11:27]** the way we’re told
how to think about things.

**[00:11:30]** It’s sort of implicit
in the educational system.

**[00:11:35]** That seems to be the point
we seem to be at.

**[00:11:40]** K: And also what am I to do?

**[00:11:43]** Even if I accept I’m an individual

**[00:11:46]** totally different
from the collective,

**[00:11:49]** what am I to do?

**[00:11:52]** Facing all the terrible things
that are going on in the world,

**[00:11:58]** what am I, a single, lonely,
separate individual,

**[00:12:05]** to affect this enormous
weight of the society?

**[00:12:16]** If I think that way,
it seems so hopeless.

**[00:12:19]** Q: Yes.

**[00:12:23]** K: So, I give it up,
or form a cult,

**[00:12:30]** which is all so meaningless.

**[00:12:34]** Perhaps, there may be
another approach.

**[00:12:38]** Q: What?
K: I’m not an individual.

**[00:12:44]** Q: One step we’ve been trying
to take so far, is to get clear

**[00:12:48]** that there’s just
one central problem,

**[00:12:50]** not a very large number of them.

**[00:12:53]** K: Sir, my problem
is a very simple problem:

**[00:12:57]** I’ve so far lived as an individual,
so far acted as an individual,

**[00:13:04]** my relationship with another
has been individualistic,

**[00:13:08]** my search for truth, for God,
has always been individualistic.

**[00:13:16]** I’ve also had the belief
that in me there is God

**[00:13:22]** and that God is looking after me,
or I must go after that God.

**[00:13:29]** It’s all been a limited,
individualistic activity.

**[00:13:36]** And seeing this enormous, complex
society, with all the horrors,

**[00:13:43]** I feel so utterly helpless.
Right?

**[00:13:48]** So, I say to myself, my thinking
may be wrong altogether.

**[00:13:55]** Q: Absolutely totally,
not partially.

**[00:13:57]** K: It may be wrong altogether,

**[00:14:00]** assuming that I’m an individual
and being incapable to affect that.

**[00:14:08]** Then I become depressed,
hopeless, neurotic,

**[00:14:12]** and run away into some institution
or some ashram or somewhere,

**[00:14:17]** and I end up there.
What’s the point all this?

**[00:14:20]** Q: Any attempt to ask

**[00:14:21]** how one could help
one’s children or one’s students

**[00:14:23]** while one’s still in this…
K: …in the same pattern.

**[00:14:25]** Q: …is doomed to failure
or very limited success.

**[00:14:33]** K: Challenge it.
Q: Maybe that’s the fact.

**[00:14:36]** Maybe it is hopeless.

**[00:14:38]** K: So, we can’t do anything.

**[00:14:41]** Q: We may be able to do something
about ourselves and people we meet.

**[00:14:46]** K: But that’s a very small affair.

**[00:14:48]** Q: Yes, but maybe we’re
very small parts of whatever exists,

**[00:14:53]** and maybe we have
to resign ourselves to this.

**[00:14:56]** Maybe this is the nature of things.

**[00:14:58]** K: I object to that.

**[00:15:04]** That’s such a limited, hopeless,
self-centred activity.

**[00:15:09]** It has no meaning.
Q: But it may be true.

**[00:15:15]** The question is,
is it true or not?

**[00:15:16]** If it’s true,
one would have to accept it.

**[00:15:19]** K: I don’t know.

**[00:15:22]** I question whether it is true.

**[00:15:25]** Q: Could I take up the point
Dr Sheldrake made a little earlier,

**[00:15:31]** that the individual

**[00:15:32]** is essentially different
from the society as a whole,

**[00:15:36]** and new properties
come into existence

**[00:15:39]** in a large assembly of individuals?

**[00:15:42]** Doubtless it is true that one
mustn’t make too close a parallel

**[00:15:48]** between individual psychology
and mass psychology

**[00:15:53]** – things can come out
in a differing degree

**[00:15:56]** in these different situations,

**[00:16:01]** and a British man
won’t normally seek

**[00:16:04]** to solve his problems with
a neighbour by murdering him,

**[00:16:09]** it is more common to do this
on a collective level.

**[00:16:12]** But this is only
a difference of degree

**[00:16:15]** because neighbours do sometimes
murder one another.

**[00:16:19]** Essentially, I don’t think
it’s very different.

**[00:16:23]** Also, I would suggest
that it would be a mistake

**[00:16:28]** to say that the individual
is related to the society

**[00:16:34]** in the same way that say a cell
is related to the whole body,

**[00:16:38]** because undoubtedly the whole body
in the assembly of cells

**[00:16:41]** has totally new properties which
the individual cell doesn’t possess.

**[00:16:46]** But I don’t think you would…

**[00:16:49]** ultimately, in the structure
and functioning of the brain,

**[00:16:53]** which, after all,
is an assembly of cells.

**[00:16:55]** But if it really were like that,
it would be very different,

**[00:17:00]** but I don’t think you’d want
to push that analogy that far.

**[00:17:04]** I think the differences of the way
in which the national leaders

**[00:17:09]** sit down to plan foreign policies
and the thinking that goes on,

**[00:17:14]** is not really very different

**[00:17:17]** from the way they think
in their personal lives

**[00:17:22]** and the way they have developed as
human beings during their childhood.

**[00:17:27]** Q: I rather think it is.

**[00:17:29]** And the analogy between society
and an organism is a very old one.

**[00:17:34]** Q: But I don’t think
it’s a good one.

**[00:17:37]** Q: I think there’s something
to be said for it.

**[00:17:39]** But I think that these politicians
are different.

**[00:17:42]** When they’re sitting at home

**[00:17:43]** chatting to their friends
and family,

**[00:17:45]** they are not saying to each other,
‘Shall we build more hydrogen bombs

**[00:17:48]** in case the neighbours
break down our fence?’

**[00:17:52]** They don’t say,

**[00:17:53]** ‘Shall we pile up more arms
because of our neighbours?’

**[00:17:56]** These are phenomenon that they
only do in their role as politicians

**[00:17:59]** as part of the society.

**[00:18:01]** I think these are
emerging properties.

**[00:18:04]** Q: This is the confusion.

**[00:18:06]** Q: People do this in all walks
of life, not just politicians.

**[00:18:09]** They separate their personal life
from their professional life.

**[00:18:13]** This is typically what individuals
experience in their daily lives.

**[00:18:20]** It’s a mistake to say

**[00:18:21]** an individual is totally different
from society or totally the same,

**[00:18:25]** but somewhere in between.

**[00:18:28]** Q: But the individual
doesn’t have so much information

**[00:18:31]** as a man who has
government responsibilities.

**[00:18:35]** That changes your outlook
completely, once you’re in power.

**[00:18:40]** Q: But, sir, aren’t we talking
about basic human psychology?

**[00:18:47]** Aren’t we talking about the psyche
of what is basically in there,

**[00:18:51]** which is fear and violence
and greed?

**[00:18:58]** My greed, as Doris pointed out,
isn’t different from anyone else’s.

**[00:19:03]** My jealously is not different
from another human being’s jealousy.

**[00:19:07]** Basically, the make-up
of all human beings is the same.

**[00:19:14]** Q: Yes, but I think when you’re
talking about education and change,

**[00:19:18]** it’s possible to conceive
of a number of individuals

**[00:19:21]** becoming non-greedy
or non-jealous or non-aggressive.

**[00:19:25]** For a whole society not to be
greedy, jealous and aggressive,

**[00:19:29]** you’ve got to have a majority,

**[00:19:31]** if not all the individuals
thinking that way.

**[00:19:34]** That means that

**[00:19:34]** whereas an individual can make
a free choice of his own

**[00:19:38]** not to be greedy or jealous
or aggressive,

**[00:19:41]** if you’re going
to make everybody like this

**[00:19:43]** and still be free individuals…

**[00:19:46]** Q: No, but I think
that’s jumping a little bit.

**[00:19:50]** Q: You made the jump from individual
greed to greed of society.

**[00:19:55]** I say that there’s a choice

**[00:19:57]** whereby an individual
can cease to be greedy.

**[00:19:59]** I agree, it can happen.

**[00:20:01]** Whether an entire society
can decide not to be greedy

**[00:20:04]** without all the individuals

**[00:20:05]** or the majority of the individuals
deciding,

**[00:20:08]** is another thing.

**[00:20:09]** You’re saying that society
is made up of the individuals.

**[00:20:11]** Q: I’m not even going that far.

**[00:20:13]** I’m saying human beings
are basically

**[00:20:16]** greedy, acquisitive, self-centred,
jealous, fearful and so on.

**[00:20:22]** That’s where I’m beginning,
I’m not going any further, as yet.

**[00:20:26]** If we start there, then perhaps
we can see where we can go,

**[00:20:30]** if one sees that part.
Q: Yes, all right, I agree.

**[00:20:35]** But I think there are differences,
some are more greedy than others.

**[00:20:40]** Q: But fear and greed is expressed
in foreign policies of nations

**[00:20:47]** and this is basically
the same as the fear and greed

**[00:20:51]** and insecurity of individuals
in their personal lives.

**[00:20:56]** Q: Yes.
Q: That’s the important thing.

**[00:21:00]** Q: Exactly.
Now moving to the next stage,

**[00:21:03]** if one’s going to transform
the whole of society

**[00:21:05]** so that it’s no longer
fearful and greedy

**[00:21:08]** then not only have we got
to transform a few individuals,

**[00:21:11]** we’ve got to transform most of them.

**[00:21:13]** And to transform most
in one particular direction,

**[00:21:17]** which goes against the normal human
nature, which is deeply ingrained,

**[00:21:21]** to my mind could only be done
by compulsion.

**[00:21:25]** Q: Isn’t this
a hypothetical situation?

**[00:21:28]** We don’t actually know
what would happen

**[00:21:31]** if you had a large group of people
who were not greedy.

**[00:21:36]** Q: We don’t know, but the original
question came up, is this possible?

**[00:21:42]** If it’s not possible, if all
that can change is individuals

**[00:21:44]** rather than entire societies,

**[00:21:47]** then the whole discussion starts

**[00:21:49]** as to whether this aim to change the
world or change society is possible,

**[00:21:55]** whether society will always
be roughly as it has been.

**[00:22:02]** Q: I’m not sure we’re actually
aiming to change society.

**[00:22:05]** I think we’ve already
made a jump there.

**[00:22:09]** It seems to me that when one
is talking about changing society,

**[00:22:14]** one normally talks
in terms of an external change.

**[00:22:18]** Q: But if we’re only talking
about changing individuals,

**[00:22:21]** then this is a different matter.

**[00:22:22]** Q: I’m not sure we’re talking
about changing individuals either.

**[00:22:25]** Q: We’re talking about education,

**[00:22:27]** and education is surely
in the business of changing.

**[00:22:31]** Q: In education, you’re trying to
see the real significance of greed.

**[00:22:36]** What is the real
significance of greed?

**[00:22:39]** Q: We’re talking about
whether oneself can change,

**[00:22:43]** not about whether we can change

**[00:22:44]** lots of people a little
or lots of people a lot.

**[00:22:47]** We’re seeing that the problem
is here in me and in you,

**[00:22:50]** as it clearly is,
as we’ve established,

**[00:22:53]** and we’re not going
very much further beyond that,

**[00:22:55]** we’re just saying, now,
can that change?

**[00:22:57]** We’re not discussing
what sort of education system

**[00:23:00]** might make it a bit easier
for it to change a little bit.

**[00:23:03]** The actual question that has been
put before us is, is it possible now

**[00:23:07]** for us here today, individually,
if you like to use that word,

**[00:23:11]** for a change to occur?
Q: But is it just that?

**[00:23:15]** Krishnaji said earlier
we live in a terrible world

**[00:23:19]** and can we do nothing about it?
K: I didn’t say that,

**[00:23:25]** that we cannot do anything about it.

**[00:23:27]** Q: No, you said,
can we do nothing about it?

**[00:23:29]** And if one can just…
this is surely not just ourselves,

**[00:23:34]** it’s the whole situation.

**[00:23:37]** Q: The question being put is,
if there is a change in us,

**[00:23:42]** then it may be possible
for other changes to come about.

**[00:23:45]** But we can’t explore that
except as speculation,

**[00:23:48]** unless the first step occurs,

**[00:23:50]** which seems to be
where we all continually stop.

**[00:23:53]** The only really valid inquiry
at the moment,

**[00:23:56]** seems to be can we change?

**[00:24:01]** We can go into what the effects
that would have on other people

**[00:24:04]** and the schools and the world,
if it comes about,

**[00:24:07]** but if we (are) putting all our
best efforts into it, can’t change,

**[00:24:10]** it’s impossible for us
to discuss change in other people.

**[00:24:17]** Q: There is no right answer
to this question,

**[00:24:20]** what am I to do?

**[00:24:25]** There is no answer to this question

**[00:24:27]** because all the answers
we shall give,

**[00:24:30]** they will be
at the level of the ‘me’,

**[00:24:36]** intellectual or emotional.

**[00:24:40]** The answer is only
when ‘me’ is not.

**[00:24:44]** So, we can discuss this.
The answers will be from ‘me’.

**[00:25:00]** Q: I don’t think we are talking
about a planned change of any kind.

**[00:25:05]** That’s what seems to be
confusing us here.

**[00:25:09]** As individuals, we are probably
capable of all kinds of behaviours,

**[00:25:14]** but there is
a sheer constraint placed

**[00:25:18]** when we are in a group such as this.

**[00:25:21]** I know when I have to say
something I have to think,

**[00:25:24]** what other people
might say, perhaps.

**[00:25:29]** K: Sir, as Mr Nicholson pointed out
just now, can I change now?

**[00:25:35]** That’s the whole problem.

**[00:25:39]** If I do change now, immediately,
how will it affect the society,

**[00:25:47]** this society which is so corrupt
and all the rest of it?

**[00:25:52]** What’s the point of my changing
if that remains like that?

**[00:25:56]** I’m just taking that up.

**[00:26:00]** Does changing my consciousness

**[00:26:04]** affect the consciousness
of the world?

**[00:26:06]** That’s all my point.

**[00:26:12]** If I accept that I’m an individual

**[00:26:16]** and I do change my consciousness,
with all its content,

**[00:26:25]** will it have any consequence

**[00:26:30]** or it’s just a slight transformation
of a little mind?

**[00:26:37]** Q: But we don’t change.

**[00:26:40]** K: I’m not saying
we shouldn’t change.

**[00:26:42]** Q: No, I’m saying we don’t change

**[00:26:43]** because it might have
an effect on other people.

**[00:26:48]** K: No, sorry.

**[00:26:51]** What is my relationship to society,

**[00:26:56]** and what is my action
towards that society?

**[00:27:02]** And if I do act correctly,

**[00:27:06]** not selfishly,
not greedily and so on,

**[00:27:10]** will it have a tremendous wave that
will cover the entirety of mankind,

**[00:27:20]** or is it just a work
in the backyard?

**[00:27:26]** Q: So long as I’m self-centred

**[00:27:29]** how do I know
the answer to that question?

**[00:27:36]** K: Answer it.
Go on, sir.

**[00:27:41]** Q: I don’t think
that’s the way it works, really.

**[00:27:47]** The change or the discussion
of the possibility of a change

**[00:27:52]** comes about from seeing
the necessity of a change.

**[00:27:55]** What happens to it later on is,
in a sense, none of your business.

**[00:27:59]** K: It’s none of my business,
I agree,

**[00:28:04]** but I’ve a feeling
that if I, as an individual,

**[00:28:08]** which I don’t accept

**[00:28:13]** – I am not an individual.

**[00:28:16]** I’m the result of the collective.

**[00:28:19]** My greed is the common greed
of mankind, my envy and so on,

**[00:28:26]** is the common factor
of all mankind, psychologically.

**[00:28:33]** So, I don’t think
in terms of the individual.

**[00:28:40]** Q: So, you don’t think
in terms of society either.

**[00:28:43]** K: No.
I think in terms of humanity

**[00:28:47]** whose consciousness is the common
consciousness of mankind.

**[00:28:54]** Q: But also, you’re not saying that
you’re bound by that consciousness?

**[00:28:59]** K: No, of course not.

**[00:29:04]** Q: You imply also, sir,
that if you think of yourself

**[00:29:09]** or approach change as an individual,

**[00:29:13]** no real fundamental change
will occur.

**[00:29:15]** K: No.

**[00:29:19]** Go on, sir,
the ball is in your court.

**[00:29:26]** Q: I agree that a change
in the consciousness of one person

**[00:29:34]** is likely to affect
the consciousness,

**[00:29:36]** in some subtle ways, of all people.

**[00:29:38]** Now, there’s a difference
between saying

**[00:29:42]** it changes the consciousness
of mankind, this is an abstraction.

**[00:29:44]** If you say it changes the
consciousness of other individuals,

**[00:29:50]** isn’t this
a different way of saying it?

**[00:29:52]** Why do you want to use
the abstraction ‘mankind’,

**[00:29:57]** rather than say ‘other individuals
throughout the world’?

**[00:30:00]** K: We’re all affected by Hitler,
Gandhi, Jesus, Buddha

**[00:30:07]** – we are always being pressurised
by all the people around us.

**[00:30:15]** We are that.

**[00:30:19]** Q: Yes. But, sir,
at the same time

**[00:30:23]** the way Hitler affects
this consciousness

**[00:30:28]** is entirely different from the way
this consciousness might be affected

**[00:30:32]** by a real change in someone.

**[00:30:37]** K: Which means
I have to be free of Hitler,

**[00:30:41]** all the Hitlerian business.

**[00:30:46]** I have to be free of the propaganda
that I’m a Hindu or a Christian.

**[00:30:53]** There must be freedom
from all this, first.

**[00:30:59]** Q: It also implies
that trying to see

**[00:31:03]** how one change in consciousness
will affect the whole…

**[00:31:08]** K: That comes a little later.

**[00:31:11]** Q: Hitler might
not be a good example.

**[00:31:14]** K: First, I do not accept
myself as an individual.

**[00:31:22]** Q: No, but if we agree that all
these changes in consciousness

**[00:31:28]** of people like Jesus
and Hitler and so on

**[00:31:32]** affect the consciousness
of other people in the world

**[00:31:36]** – which I do accept myself –

**[00:31:39]** then we still have the problem

**[00:31:41]** that there’s consciousness
of individuals,

**[00:31:46]** or at least of people – I’ll use
the word ‘people’ not ‘individual’ –

**[00:31:53]** is changed

**[00:31:55]** but we are still left
with the problem of societies,

**[00:31:58]** namely nation states, castes,
communities and so on,

**[00:32:02]** all seem to have their own
historical dynamics

**[00:32:05]** and they all seem to go on according
to their own historical mores.

**[00:32:09]** Although the people within them
all over the world

**[00:32:11]** are affected by this collective
human consciousness…

**[00:32:19]** …lots of different societies,
all with different sorts of rules,

**[00:32:22]** all depending on their own
historical purpose

**[00:32:24]** and historical conflicts between
each other in other societies.

**[00:32:28]** These seem to have
a different dynamic

**[00:32:30]** that seems to go on independently.

**[00:32:33]** K: Yes, sir,
but do we acknowledge

**[00:32:38]** that the basic psychological
content of each one of us

**[00:32:44]** is common to all mankind?
That’s all, first.

**[00:32:49]** Q: Yes, I acknowledge that.

**[00:32:51]** K: So, my consciousness,
which is greed, envy, all that,

**[00:32:56]** is the common consciousness
of mankind.

**[00:33:01]** However dynamic,
however this or that,

**[00:33:04]** it is the common ground
on which we all stand.

**[00:33:09]** Q: Yes.

**[00:33:11]** K: The moment you admit that,
I am not an individual.

**[00:33:19]** Nor are you an individual.

**[00:33:22]** Your consciousness is
the consciousness of all mankind.

**[00:33:29]** Q: In one sense it is
and in another sense it isn’t.

**[00:33:32]** K: Stick to one sense.

**[00:33:34]** I can play this ball game
back and forth.

**[00:33:41]** Q: All right, in one sense,
yes, it is.

**[00:33:44]** K: As long
as I am not an individual,

**[00:33:49]** my whole thinking is different.

**[00:34:00]** My thinking is not individualistic,

**[00:34:05]** my thinking is the common ground
on which we stand.

**[00:34:12]** If there is a change
in one part of consciousness,

**[00:34:17]** it affects the whole,

**[00:34:21]** the group consciousness,
collective consciousness.

**[00:34:28]** Q: Yes, I accept that.
K: If you accept that,

**[00:34:32]** then our education is
not individualistic education

**[00:34:38]** but the education which is to empty
the content of one’s consciousness

**[00:34:49]** – greed, envy, fear,
sorrow, beliefs,

**[00:34:52]** all that kind of collective thing,
which is collective.

**[00:35:01]** Q: Yes.
K: And is that possible?

**[00:35:08]** Q: I think it is,

**[00:35:11]** but I don’t know
if it’s possible through education.

**[00:35:14]** K: Let’s forget
the word ‘education’.

**[00:35:16]** Q: All right.

**[00:35:17]** K: Is that possible,
for this consciousness,

**[00:35:21]** common consciousness,

**[00:35:24]** for that consciousness
which is now in me,

**[00:35:29]** can that content be

**[00:35:36]** – what? – transformed,
not gradually but immediately?

**[00:35:42]** That’s the question he has been
raising and he’s sticking to that.

**[00:35:46]** So am I.

**[00:35:52]** Q: Can we also make the implication
from that, that if that happens,

**[00:35:57]** that, in turn, affects
the collective consciousness?

**[00:36:01]** K: Of course.

**[00:36:03]** Q: Therefore, a new factor
is added or injected into

**[00:36:08]** that totality of consciousness.
Q: Yes.

**[00:36:12]** But it wouldn’t mean
that everybody else

**[00:36:14]** would immediately undergo
the same transformation.

**[00:36:17]** It might make it easier
for subsequent peoples.

**[00:36:19]** Q: Are we making a mistake to try
and make it numerically everybody?

**[00:36:24]** That’s such an absolute.

**[00:36:26]** Q: We’re talking about the fact
that we’re related to the collective

**[00:36:31]** and things affect other people.

**[00:36:34]** I’m just trying to analyse to what
extent they affect other people,

**[00:36:37]** whether we are talking about…
Q: I think you can’t measure.

**[00:36:42]** Q: We’re talking numerically.

**[00:36:44]** We are talking about
in other people,

**[00:36:46]** or other members of the human race.

**[00:36:50]** Q: We’re also talking qualitatively.
It’s not just a matter of numbers.

**[00:36:55]** A qualitative change.

**[00:36:57]** Q: But I’m asking is,

**[00:36:58]** if this qualitative change
occurs in one person,

**[00:37:02]** in a sense, it affects
other members of the human race,

**[00:37:07]** but I’m simply asking the question,
in what way?

**[00:37:12]** Does it affect them as making easier
a potential for change in them?

**[00:37:18]** Would it make it easier for them
to undergo the same sort of change?

**[00:37:22]** Will they themselves
have to undergo it?

**[00:37:26]** It might make it easier for them
to do it, lower the threshold,

**[00:37:29]** for this change to occur in others.

**[00:37:33]** What sort of effect does it have?
That’s really what I’m asking.

**[00:37:38]** K: Sir, as we came to yesterday,
we are a collection of memories.

**[00:37:47]** You agreed to that.
Q: Yes.

**[00:37:51]** K: Completely a collection
of memories.

**[00:37:53]** Q: No, we didn’t say
we were completely.

**[00:37:56]** K: What is that?

**[00:37:58]** Q: We didn’t say
it was completely.

**[00:38:00]** K: Oh, I see.
Partially, yes.

**[00:38:04]** Let’s come to a point.
I say completely.

**[00:38:10]** My tradition, belief,

**[00:38:14]** the whole cultural,
educational movement

**[00:38:19]** is to cultivate memory.

**[00:38:25]** And when I say my whole
consciousness is memory,

**[00:38:36]** you say, ‘No, partly’.

**[00:38:39]** Which means there is some part
in me or in that consciousness

**[00:38:44]** which is not memory.

**[00:38:49]** I say, how can that be?

**[00:38:53]** That may also be another memory,
which I have sublimated.

**[00:39:02]** Q: But you yourself refuted that
by bringing up love.

**[00:39:06]** K: Ah! No, don’t go back to that
for the moment.

**[00:39:11]** I am trying to find out

**[00:39:13]** if the whole of my consciousness
is memory,

**[00:39:22]** how can one go beyond all that?
That’s my question.

**[00:39:31]** Not I have a part somewhere
hidden in me which is not memory.

**[00:39:39]** That’s a Hindu concept, a different
Christian concept, and so on,

**[00:39:44]** there is in me
a certain clarity of heaven,

**[00:39:50]** which is guiding, which is helping,
which is shaping.

**[00:39:55]** Personally, I don’t accept that.

**[00:39:58]** That’s also part of my tradition
which has been handed down to me,

**[00:40:05]** which is memory, again.

**[00:40:11]** Q: The concept of it may be a memory

**[00:40:15]** but the experience of it may not be.

**[00:40:19]** K: The fact may not?
Q: Yes, the fact may not be.

**[00:40:21]** K: How do I know the fact?

**[00:40:25]** Q: Through memory.

**[00:40:26]** Q: No, you can know it directly.

**[00:40:31]** Q: Through experience.
Q: Through intuition.

**[00:40:33]** K: Through experience.

**[00:40:37]** Experience is
the most dangerous thing.

**[00:40:40]** One can say
there is this, inside me,

**[00:40:46]** a spot of absolute purity, etc.
I can experience that.

**[00:40:54]** But that experience
is already preconceived.

**[00:41:04]** Q: Not necessarily.
It could happen spontaneously.

**[00:41:08]** K: Now, wait a minute.

**[00:41:09]** To be spontaneous,
you must have freedom.

**[00:41:13]** You must have total freedom from
all this, to be really spontaneous.

**[00:41:19]** Q: Well, does the spontaneity
override the conditioning,

**[00:41:23]** or do you have to get rid
of the conditioning first?

**[00:41:27]** It seems this isn’t at all clear
how this could…

**[00:41:33]** K: Please, somebody take it off me.

**[00:41:36]** Q: Obviously, it has to happen
spontaneously.

**[00:41:38]** You can’t through deliberate action
override all your conditioning

**[00:41:42]** – that’s clearly
another kind of conditioning.

**[00:41:45]** Q: How are you going to find out
answers to some of these questions?

**[00:41:52]** Q: Well, we were given the answer
yesterday, that’s the point.

**[00:41:59]** We came to this point yesterday
and then…

**[00:42:03]** Q: Is that the same
as being given the answer?

**[00:42:06]** Q: Well, I thought
the answer was quite clear.

**[00:42:13]** The thing that Krishnaji raised
that wasn’t memory was love.

**[00:42:19]** This seemed to provide

**[00:42:24]** a clear answer to something
that isn’t memory.

**[00:42:28]** K: All right, just let’s
look at that for a minute.

**[00:42:31]** I am memory and you have told me
a love, which is not memory.

**[00:42:38]** Right? You have indicated,
you have suggested,

**[00:42:41]** you have shown me
something which is not.

**[00:42:48]** Is it possible
for this memory to subside,

**[00:42:54]** so that the other can be?
You follow my question?

**[00:42:58]** Q: Yes, I think that’s
a great mystery. I don’t know.

**[00:43:03]** K: Why do you call it a mystery?
Did you call it a mystery?

**[00:43:07]** Q: Yes.
K: Why?

**[00:43:12]** Q: Because the relation
between memory

**[00:43:15]** which is the conditioning effect

**[00:43:16]** on our own individual
and collective pasts,

**[00:43:21]** and something which is
free and spontaneous,

**[00:43:25]** it’s not clear what the relation
between these two things could be

**[00:43:28]** because they’re incommensurate,

**[00:43:30]** and therefore the relation
between them must be a mystery.

**[00:43:34]** There’s no clear and rational
connection between the two.

**[00:43:38]** Q: Would you say that if one of the
two were absent, the other would be?

**[00:43:45]** Q: Or is one born from the other?

**[00:43:48]** Q: Well, my own view, I suppose,

**[00:43:53]** is that the creative
activity of love,

**[00:43:58]** as it works it casts off a residue,

**[00:44:01]** or it leaves behind
a sort of residue

**[00:44:04]** which becomes memory.

**[00:44:06]** In the great religions of the world,
one can see this process happening.

**[00:44:12]** Something that starts as living,
free and spontaneous

**[00:44:17]** leading to a shell,

**[00:44:19]** which can become an empty shell,
which is then part of the tradition.

**[00:44:25]** So, that’s one relation
between the two.

**[00:44:28]** I can see how you could
get to memories from love.

**[00:44:31]** I can’t see how you could
get to love from memory.

**[00:44:38]** Q: If you could deal with memory
in a way that would evaporate it

**[00:44:47]** in the active sense in the mind,

**[00:44:49]** wouldn’t that be like
opening a window

**[00:44:52]** and letting something else in?

**[00:44:54]** Q: Yes, but I don’t think you could
actually evaporate it through will.

**[00:44:58]** Q: Not through will, but is there
some other way of evaporating it?

**[00:45:03]** Q: You’d have to just let it come.
You couldn’t do it deliberately.

**[00:45:09]** Nor do I see how you could
do it repeatedly or regularly.

**[00:45:13]** It seems to me that most of the time
we have to live in the world,

**[00:45:16]** and we need our memories.

**[00:45:17]** We may have moments
when this insight comes

**[00:45:20]** but it’s not something we can
maintain 24 hours a day

**[00:45:23]** or many times a day.

**[00:45:25]** K: Sir, we said too yesterday,
if I remember, love is not memory.

**[00:45:30]** Q: Yes.
K: But my whole being is memory.

**[00:45:37]** Q: Well, some of it.
K: My whole being is memory.

**[00:45:41]** I don’t admit there is some
spark in me which is not memory.

**[00:45:45]** That, again, maybe tradition.

**[00:45:49]** So, I don’t know
what that love is.

**[00:45:55]** I really don’t.
Suppose I don’t.

**[00:45:58]** Then what am I to do with this thing
called memory, which is me?

**[00:46:05]** That’s the question.

**[00:46:10]** Q: But if try to do
something with it

**[00:46:12]** I’m back into the same old trap.

**[00:46:15]** We came to a point yesterday when
you were talking about listening.

**[00:46:19]** K: Sir, go back, go into it.
I am memory

**[00:46:23]** and you have told me
love is not that.

**[00:46:32]** But my whole being is
this extraordinary collection

**[00:46:38]** of memories, experiences,
tradition, all that.

**[00:46:45]** And I may not be able
to capture that thing.

**[00:46:48]** So, I’m only concerned
with this.

**[00:46:56]** That may be your imagination,
just something which is romantic.

**[00:47:03]** But I’m stranded with this.

**[00:47:07]** You’re talking about the other bank
but I’m on this side of the bank.

**[00:47:14]** So, what am I to do?
What is the action or non-action?

**[00:47:23]** Please, don’t introduce spontaneity,
if you don’t mind.

**[00:47:28]** I am here, on this bank

**[00:47:32]** and there is no boat
to take me across there,

**[00:47:36]** so I am stuck with this.

**[00:47:39]** What am I to do?

**[00:47:50]** I have meditated, sacrificed,
I have disciplined,

**[00:47:56]** I’ve done every kind
of dirty trick I can invent

**[00:48:01]** and I’m still there.

**[00:48:15]** Q: I can’t move from here,
if I feel that.

**[00:48:22]** If I feel that I’m confronted
with this realisation

**[00:48:27]** that this is all I am,
there’s no way out,

**[00:48:30]** because I’ve tried all that.

**[00:48:31]** K: I don’t admit
there is no way out.

**[00:48:35]** Q: Not with my usual attitude
or way of life.

**[00:48:43]** I’ve tried all the ways out
and see that as I am now,

**[00:48:48]** there is no way out
and I can’t move from here.

**[00:48:53]** K: So, I am
on this side of the bank.

**[00:48:57]** It’s a simile, that’s good enough.

**[00:49:00]** I’m on this side of the bank.

**[00:49:04]** I have done every kind of thing man
has invented to reach the other bank

**[00:49:11]** but at the end of it,
I’m still here.

**[00:49:17]** And I ask you, who are all
very well educated, etc.,

**[00:49:22]** I say, ‘Please,
what am I to do?’

**[00:49:27]** I have been to all the gurus,
all the rubbish.

**[00:49:32]** I’ve finished with them.
I’m still here.

**[00:49:38]** Q: The attempt to get to the
other bank is surely a rejection.

**[00:49:42]** A rejection. The fact that I want
to go to the other bank...

**[00:49:45]** K: I don’t. I can’t.

**[00:49:49]** I have tried
to get to the other bank.

**[00:49:54]** All the educated, clever people,
the saints, the gurus,

**[00:49:59]** everybody says, ‘Do this, do that
and do the other thing’,

**[00:50:02]** and at the end of it,
I am still here.

**[00:50:05]** Q: But I’m not accepting it.

**[00:50:09]** K: I am accepting it.

**[00:50:13]** I am here. I don’t say I don’t
want to be here. I am there.

**[00:50:20]** You’re not facing something.

**[00:50:23]** Q: At the end of Friday,
didn’t we come to the point

**[00:50:25]** where you see that any effort
to get across the river...

**[00:50:29]** K: I don’t want to...

**[00:50:32]** Q:...is part of the same thing
that’s keeping you there.

**[00:50:37]** And if I remember correctly,

**[00:50:40]** you said that
if you remain with that.

**[00:50:43]** K: That’s all I’m saying.
I am stuck here.

**[00:50:48]** I don’t know
what the other bank is.

**[00:50:52]** I don’t want
to imagine the other bank.

**[00:50:55]** I’m not even interested
in the other bank. I’m here

**[00:51:00]** with my sorrow,
my pleasures, with my agony

**[00:51:03]** and all the rest of
the beastly existence that I live.

**[00:51:13]** And I say to myself,
‘What am I to do?’

**[00:51:16]** Or not to do anything at all

**[00:51:22]** may be the most positive action.

**[00:51:28]** Q: We cannot escape that existence
you’ve just described.

**[00:51:36]** Q: We can’t escape that existence.
K: I am that.

**[00:51:43]** I have been
through all those tricks.

**[00:51:45]** I’m fairly intelligent.
I’m stuck here

**[00:51:49]** and I say, ‘Any movement from me is
still part of the same old pattern’.

**[00:51:59]** So, I won’t move.

**[00:52:11]** I don’t reject, I don’t accept,
I don’t try to escape from it.

**[00:52:17]** I say, ‘Here I am’.

**[00:52:22]** Q: Isn’t there a transforming
quality in just seeing it

**[00:52:27]** and being with it?
Just see that.

**[00:52:31]** Doesn’t that transform
the situation?

**[00:52:34]** K: I don’t know.

**[00:52:41]** Please, can we discuss that?

**[00:52:45]** Q: It’s a very special not doing
anything that you’re talking about.

**[00:52:51]** K: But I have done everything.
Q: But the not doing of anything...

**[00:52:55]** K: I have come to the point
when I see whatever I do is still…

**[00:53:02]** on this side of the bank.

**[00:53:04]** So, I refuse to do anything.

**[00:53:08]** Q: There are some kinds
of not doing anything,

**[00:53:11]** which most of the world does

**[00:53:14]** which doesn’t do anything either.
K: I’m not talking of the world.

**[00:53:16]** Leave the world, for the moment.

**[00:53:19]** I have experimented,
I have meditated,

**[00:53:21]** I have talked about kundalini,

**[00:53:24]** I’ve talked about this and that
and every other kind of rubbish,

**[00:53:27]** and I’m still stuck at this end.

**[00:53:30]** You’re not answering my question.

**[00:53:32]** I am here.
I refuse to move.

**[00:53:38]** Q: But haven’t I reached
some kind of love there?

**[00:53:43]** I’m not individual any longer then.
I have achieved something already.

**[00:53:54]** Q: The great preoccupation with the
‘I’, the wish to transform oneself,

**[00:54:01]** is itself a negative thing.

**[00:54:04]** The image of the river bank
is perhaps not inclusive enough.

**[00:54:07]** We are in life,
we are in relationships...

**[00:54:11]** K: I have been through all that.

**[00:54:18]** I have altered my relationship
with my wife, with my friends.

**[00:54:22]** I’ve played all that thing.

**[00:54:25]** At the end of it all I say,
‘I’m still here’.

**[00:54:33]** I’m not depressed, I’m not hopeless,
I haven’t thrown up the sponge.

**[00:54:38]** Q: You’re not accepting that either.
There’s no acceptance in that.

**[00:54:42]** K: No.

**[00:54:44]** Are we together at that point?
That’s my point.

**[00:54:51]** Or are we still intellectually
playing the game

**[00:54:56]** or emotionally, romantically say,

**[00:54:58]** ‘There is the other bank,
how lovely,

**[00:55:00]** God is looking after me
and there is in me’ – etc., etc.?

**[00:55:10]** Knowing politics won’t change.

**[00:55:15]** Those politicians are like me,
greedy, seeking power, position,

**[00:55:20]** all the rest of the ugly business.

**[00:55:26]** Q: They may be, but we are
also saying that we are better.

**[00:55:30]** K: I’m not saying that.
I am part of that whole structure.

**[00:55:45]** So, I say to myself, ‘I’ll just
not move from that position’.

**[00:55:51]** Move in the sense, let thought
invade with any kind of enticement.

**[00:56:17]** Q: I don’t see what there is
to say, in the circumstances.

**[00:56:23]** I don’t see any way out of that.
K: There is a way out.

**[00:56:29]** Q: But that means we’re all dying
to hear what the way out is.

**[00:56:35]** K: Wait a minute.

**[00:56:37]** I’ve refused all the gurus,
so you can’t make me into a guru.

**[00:56:50]** Q: So, how do we know
there’s a way out?

**[00:56:54]** K: If you will listen,
I shall tell you.

**[00:57:15]** Sir, I’m dreadfully serious
over this matter

**[00:57:20]** because I don’t think there is
any other action but non-action,

**[00:57:31]** because we’re always acting,
trying to do something about it.

**[00:57:39]** Q: We are not completely
discontent in that state.

**[00:57:43]** K: Yes. I’m not trying to run away.
I’m not trying to suppress myself.

**[00:57:51]** Thought is totally inactive.

**[00:58:00]** Because thought
has put me on this bank.

**[00:58:05]** Right? That’s the first thing
I’ve realised,

**[00:58:10]** that thought has put me
on this bank.

**[00:58:20]** If thought says again,
‘I want to get there’,

**[00:58:23]** it’s the past, I’m still here.

**[00:58:30]** So, can one remain there
without any thought?

**[00:58:37]** You understand what I mean
by thought?

**[00:58:40]** Not become vague, or a vegetable,

**[00:58:44]** just without
the pressure of thought,

**[00:58:47]** without the interference
of thought.

**[00:59:31]** Q: Krishnaji, the great danger
in what you’ve just said

**[00:59:34]** seems to be that it becomes
a prescription.

**[00:59:39]** K: It is not.

**[00:59:43]** Is it a prescription?

**[00:59:46]** Q: Krishnaji, the pressure
of thought is really the problem,

**[00:59:50]** the interference of thought
isn’t really the problem.

**[00:59:53]** K: Because thought has created
this mess in the world. Right, sir?

**[01:00:01]** Q: Yes.

**[01:00:04]** K: And the politicians are still
working in the field of thought.

**[01:00:09]** Thought being partial, their
activity will always be partial.

**[01:00:17]** Scientists, the artists,
they are all partial.

**[01:00:28]** So, is it possible for thought
to see that what it has done?

**[01:00:41]** Both the beautiful architecture,
surgery and all the rest of it,

**[01:00:45]** but also, psychologically
what thought has done

**[01:00:50]** – created such havoc
in our relationship with each other.

**[01:00:57]** And for thought itself to realise
that it cannot interfere.

**[01:01:08]** This is the real problem.
Go on, discuss with me.

**[01:01:12]** Can thought perceive itself?

**[01:01:24]** Q: But you’re introducing something.

**[01:01:28]** That there may be something
in thought that isn’t conditioned.

**[01:01:34]** K: My question is, please

**[01:01:38]** – I’m not challenging you,
I’m just questioning –

**[01:01:42]** my question is,
can thought see itself,

**[01:01:58]** be aware of itself,
see its movement?

**[01:02:11]** What is this?

**[01:02:16]** Q: We can see the structure
of thoughts and ideas,

**[01:02:21]** but we’re always doing it
with other thoughts.

**[01:02:23]** So, we can always stand back
and look at thoughts.

**[01:02:26]** K: Then, who is it
that stands back?

**[01:02:30]** Q: As long as we’re considering
other thoughts,

**[01:02:33]** it seems to be other thoughts.

**[01:02:37]** K: That is still thought.

**[01:02:39]** Q: Yes, we can see some thoughts
but with other thoughts.

**[01:02:43]** K: No, not one thought
sees another thought

**[01:02:47]** – that’s not my question –

**[01:02:50]** but thought itself,
observes itself.

**[01:02:59]** Q: I don’t know
if that’s possible or not.

**[01:03:02]** Q: So far, we’ve said

**[01:03:03]** that all our thoughts
are conditioned by our past.

**[01:03:06]** So, if that’s the case...

**[01:03:10]** K: Madame, can I observe
the rising of anger?

**[01:03:18]** You can.
Q: Yes.

**[01:03:23]** K: Is there an awareness
of thought arising? Of itself.

**[01:03:35]** Q: I don’t think so.

**[01:03:38]** K: Go on, let’s find out.

**[01:03:42]** Q: I don’t see
how thought can observe itself.

**[01:03:47]** There is something beyond thought
which is the observer.

**[01:03:51]** K: Then you introduce
another factor.

**[01:03:56]** Q: One does, but I think
that’s what is there.

**[01:03:58]** K: That’s just the difficulty,
that’s what I’m asking.

**[01:04:01]** Q: I feel that is real.

**[01:04:04]** K: I’m aware when anger arises.

**[01:04:09]** I can see the whole movement of it.

**[01:04:12]** Or greed,

**[01:04:15]** violence and so on.

**[01:04:18]** Why is it not possible

**[01:04:20]** for thought itself
to be aware, as it arises?

**[01:04:26]** If it is possible in one direction,
why not thought itself?

**[01:04:35]** Q: But what sees the anger arising?

**[01:04:37]** Is it thoughts
or is it something else?

**[01:04:44]** K: Can’t you see, sir?

**[01:04:46]** Look, you call me a fool

**[01:04:50]** and I can see the reaction,
getting annoyed with the word.

**[01:04:56]** Q: Yes, but Krishnaji,
when you see it, it seems to stop.

**[01:04:59]** K: Not a question of seems to stop,
but the very arising, sir.

**[01:05:05]** Q: Yes, you can see the arising.
K: Wait, wait, wait.

**[01:05:09]** Arising, that’s all I’m asking.

**[01:05:14]** Is there an observation…?
Can thought observe itself arising?

**[01:05:25]** Q: In the first case,
does anger see itself arising

**[01:05:30]** or does thought see anger arising?
K: No, sir.

**[01:05:35]** Q: What action takes place?

**[01:05:40]** K: Sir, when I’m angry
it bursts out – right? –

**[01:05:46]** then, a few seconds later,
I say to myself, ‘I’ve been angry’.

**[01:05:52]** At the moment of anger,
I’m not aware that I’m angry.

**[01:05:57]** It’s only later.

**[01:05:59]** Now, I am asking
at the arising of anger, not later.

**[01:06:08]** Q: You’re saying something
quite simple.

**[01:06:11]** I can’t put it into words very well
but there seems to be a watchfulness

**[01:06:16]** that seems to be very aware
of something coming.

**[01:06:22]** K: Are we tremendously
complicating a very simple thing?

**[01:06:28]** Q: I think maybe we are.

**[01:06:30]** We’ve all had moments
when you realise

**[01:06:34]** that thought has been absent.

**[01:06:39]** Isn’t that thought watching thought
because it’s come back?

**[01:06:43]** K: No. When you say,
‘I have watched thought acting…’

**[01:06:48]** Q: No, no, not acting.
You suddenly become aware…

**[01:06:54]** K: Not ‘you become’ – you see?
Q: I’m not putting it very well.

**[01:06:59]** I’m assuming that we all have
moments, I certainly have had,

**[01:07:04]** when you realise
that thought has been absent.

**[01:07:09]** But when you realise that,
thought is back.

**[01:07:12]** K: Yes, that’s all.

**[01:07:13]** Q: But that moment of realisation
is thought watching a thought?

**[01:07:19]** K: Go on, explain it to yourself,
you’ll see it.

**[01:07:28]** You said just now that
– I’m just repeating it –

**[01:07:34]** that you watched
thought arising.

**[01:07:38]** Right?
Q: Yes.

**[01:07:40]** K: And you saw
that thought was acting.

**[01:07:44]** Q: No, it had been absent.
K: All right – it has been absent.

**[01:07:50]** Also, at other times
you saw thought is active.

**[01:07:54]** Q: Well, the very moment
when you realise

**[01:07:58]** that thought has come to an end,
it’s back.

**[01:08:02]** That realisation is thought,
isn’t it?

**[01:08:05]** K: Yes, of course.

**[01:08:08]** Q: It seems the same
as observing anger arising,

**[01:08:12]** the observation of thought coming
back, is thought watching thought.

**[01:08:19]** K: I’m talking about
thought itself, per se, arising.

**[01:08:25]** Is that possible? That gentleman
says it’s not possible.

**[01:08:28]** It may be.

**[01:08:31]** Or there is no watcher at all.

**[01:08:40]** Now we are thinking in terms
of watcher and the watched.

**[01:08:46]** Q: But isn’t it the same thing?
K: No, that’s an idea still.

**[01:08:52]** Q: Is it the totality of thought
then, in itself?

**[01:08:58]** Q: Is it the totality
of thought in itself?

**[01:09:03]** K: I don’t have to answer.
Answer it.

**[01:09:07]** I’m not the only guru here
– we’re all gurus.

**[01:09:13]** Q: There seems to be a state
of awareness which is not thought.

**[01:09:23]** Q: It seems to me that
thought is such a fragmented thing

**[01:09:27]** that I don’t see
how thought can watch itself.

**[01:09:31]** How can a fragmented thing
watch itself?

**[01:09:40]** K: Then, I realise I am memory,
a bundle of memories,

**[01:09:47]** I’m on this side of the bank
– right? –

**[01:09:54]** and thought has realised
that any movement from it

**[01:10:02]** is still to move within
the limited area of the bank.

**[01:10:09]** Right?

**[01:10:11]** Q: Yes, sir.

**[01:10:13]** K: I have come to that point,
that any movement of thought

**[01:10:17]** is to bring back to this memory,
to this side of the bank.

**[01:10:25]** So, thought itself says,
‘There must be no interference’.

**[01:10:33]** I don’t know if I’m making it clear.

**[01:10:37]** Q: Are you saying that thought
itself has seen that any movement…

**[01:10:41]** K: Yes.
That’s all for the moment.

**[01:10:47]** Q: Is that the same as saying
that is a moment of insight?

**[01:10:55]** K: No, let’s forget insight
for the moment.

**[01:11:05]** Sir, thought has realised
what it has done.

**[01:11:10]** It has built the most marvellous
cathedrals, temples and mosques,

**[01:11:15]** and all the things in the mosques,
in the temples, in the churches.

**[01:11:20]** Thought has realised it has created
marvellous instruments of surgery.

**[01:11:28]** It has also realised the submarine,
the torpedoes, the man-of-war.

**[01:11:34]** Also, it has realised
thought is fear,

**[01:11:37]** pleasure, thought is suffering.

**[01:11:41]** Thought itself has seen
itself in action. Right?

**[01:11:47]** Of course, this is simple.
One can see this.

**[01:11:53]** And thought says,
‘I am all that’.

**[01:11:59]** It may not express it verbally.
Thought realises, this is me.

**[01:12:08]** Not the man-of-war, fortunately.
This is me.

**[01:12:14]** So, thought says to itself,

**[01:12:18]** ‘By Jove, I must be quiet,
not interfere’.

**[01:12:37]** So, that is a tremendous
revolution, isn’t it?

**[01:12:44]** Q: You’re making the thought
to be very creative.

**[01:12:47]** K: Not creative – it realises, sir.

**[01:12:49]** What is the courage?
There is no value.

**[01:12:52]** What thought has created is courage.

**[01:13:06]** I wonder if we have realised,
if I may most respectfully ask,

**[01:13:12]** if we realise
the activity of thought,

**[01:13:17]** its immense contribution
and its immense danger?

**[01:13:40]** Q: Krishnaji, are you suggesting
that thought might help us

**[01:13:43]** to look at things differently?
K: No.

**[01:13:58]** Look, Mr Jenkins, thought has
created the instruments of surgery,

**[01:14:05]** the most extraordinarily
delicate instruments. Right?

**[01:14:12]** And also thought
has created the submarine.

**[01:14:20]** And also thought has created God,

**[01:14:27]** the thought that in me
there is that marvellous state.

**[01:14:33]** Thought has also created misery,
confusion, division between nations.

**[01:14:41]** Thought has been responsible
for all this misery.

**[01:14:47]** I wonder if one realises that.

**[01:14:49]** Not verbally – deeply,
profoundly, in one’s guts.

**[01:15:03]** Q: In that realisation,

**[01:15:04]** there is the ability for it
to stop its continuity.

**[01:15:08]** K: No, in that realisation,
thought itself says, ‘By Jove…

**[01:15:15]** anything I do
must be still contributing to that’.

**[01:15:49]** Q: Then what happens?
Q: Nothing.

**[01:15:53]** K: What do you mean, what happens?
Q: Thought stops in its track.

**[01:15:58]** K: Does – forgive me
for asking you, sir –

**[01:16:03]** with you, does thought
stop in its track?

**[01:16:07]** Q: Sometimes it does.
K: No, no, ‘sometimes’

**[01:16:11]** – that’s like being hungry
sometimes.

**[01:16:15]** But does it stop in its own track,
say, ‘No further’?

**[01:16:36]** Q: That would include all one’s
individuality, one’s future plans,

**[01:16:41]** as well as the movement of thought.
K: Of course.

**[01:16:44]** After all, sir, if you once admit
thought is partial

**[01:16:51]** – because it is born of knowledge
and knowledge is never complete –

**[01:16:55]** if you once admit that,
it’s always partial,

**[01:17:02]** then one begins to see its
contradictions – you follow? –

**[01:17:08]** its activity, the nature
of a beautiful instrument,

**[01:17:17]** and also the divisions,
the miseries.

**[01:17:21]** Thought, it is really
responsible for all this.

**[01:17:25]** Q: The whole of one’s
relationship to the world.

**[01:17:32]** K: Thought is not the universe.

**[01:17:36]** Q: The whole of my relationship
to the world.

**[01:17:38]** K: Yes, the whole of me is thought.

**[01:17:42]** Q: So, it’s not just
the movement of thought

**[01:17:45]** which is going to stop in my mind
for a moment or two

**[01:17:47]** but it’s the whole movement
of the world, as I know it.

**[01:17:53]** K: That is, is there freedom
– sorry –

**[01:17:58]** is there a freedom
from knowledge?

**[01:18:04]** Or am I always working
within knowledge,

**[01:18:10]** which is memory?

**[01:18:13]** Well, sir?

**[01:18:18]** Q: One thing I didn’t understand.
You said, ‘I begin to see’.

**[01:18:23]** That would imply
this is a process in time.

**[01:18:27]** K: Yes, sir.

**[01:18:28]** Q: I’m not being awkward,
I’m trying to understand it.

**[01:19:22]** K: Is it possible not to think
in terms of time?

**[01:19:42]** To put it differently,
is it possible

**[01:19:48]** to end totally
this becoming something,

**[01:20:04]** which is time?
Right, sir?

**[01:20:08]** Can that end?

**[01:20:17]** So, to come back,

**[01:20:20]** is education helping us
to live in becoming?

**[01:20:34]** Q: Yes.

**[01:20:39]** That’s the way education
is structured.

**[01:20:42]** K: I know, it is structured,

**[01:20:43]** so let’s break,
look at it differently.

**[01:20:51]** I have a son. I haven’t.
Suppose I have a son or a daughter.

**[01:20:58]** How am I to help them
to see this point?

**[01:21:03]** Where examinations exist,

**[01:21:06]** college, university,
in one direction,

**[01:21:11]** to get a job,

**[01:21:14]** to get a career, specialisation,

**[01:21:19]** and also, psychologically,
he’s doing the same, inwardly.

**[01:21:25]** Becoming something,

**[01:21:31]** reaching nirvana,
reaching heaven, reaching God,

**[01:21:36]** – all that, which is
becoming, becoming.

**[01:21:38]** ‘I am not that,
but I will be that’.

**[01:21:45]** Can all that movement end?

**[01:22:00]** Q: Thought can only exist in time.
K: Of course, sir.

**[01:22:06]** Thought is time.

**[01:22:15]** Q: But is becoming thought?

**[01:22:17]** Do you think that even if one’s
in a state of thoughtlessness,

**[01:22:23]** not thinking,

**[01:22:25]** that becoming can continue
in the absence of thought?

**[01:22:30]** Or the sense of becoming
can exist in the absence of thought?

**[01:22:34]** K: Sense of becoming,
of course, psychologically.

**[01:22:38]** Because, sir, look, I’m violent,
I will be non-violent

**[01:22:43]** – which is becoming.
Q: That’s thought.

**[01:22:46]** Q: Yes, but I’m talking

**[01:22:50]** whether the sense of becoming
is itself thought

**[01:22:52]** or whether there’s a sense
of becoming which...

**[01:22:56]** I’m thinking, for example,
if one looks at animals,

**[01:23:00]** many animals are not thinking
in any normal sense of the word,

**[01:23:03]** and yet they’re becoming,

**[01:23:05]** and their entire being
is devoted to becoming.

**[01:23:09]** K: Are they becoming
psychologically or physically?

**[01:23:17]** Q: Well, I think they do both.

**[01:23:20]** They grow and develop

**[01:23:21]** and then they carry out
a series of actions

**[01:23:27]** which are related to becoming
in various ways.

**[01:23:31]** K: But is that becoming different
from my becoming non-violent?

**[01:23:41]** You understand my question?
Q: Yes.

**[01:23:44]** I don’t know.
That’s my question.

**[01:23:47]** What I’m trying to find out
is whether becoming,

**[01:23:52]** which is basically
within our biological nature…

**[01:23:56]** K: Biologically, yes, I admit that.

**[01:23:58]** Q: Then there’s a sort
of higher level of becoming

**[01:24:02]** where thought is concerned with
becoming, with desires and actions.

**[01:24:06]** K: That’s it. That’s it.

**[01:24:07]** Q: Now, if one goes beyond that,

**[01:24:09]** is there an intrinsic
sort of becoming

**[01:24:12]** that persists even beyond thought?

**[01:24:18]** Is time merely a conception or is it
something intrinsically built in

**[01:24:23]** that somehow persists
even in the absence of thought?

**[01:24:28]** Q: You mean, do we go on
getting older if we don’t think?

**[01:24:31]** Q: No.

**[01:24:34]** If in the absence of thought we have
any kind of consciousness at all.

**[01:24:39]** If it’s just blank,
then there’s nothing to say.

**[01:24:42]** Q: Where does the word ‘blank’
come from?

**[01:24:47]** Q: We’re talking about something
– we have to use words.

**[01:24:51]** K: No, I’m not talking
of being blank.

**[01:24:53]** Q: No, I said if it’s a blank,

**[01:24:56]** then there’s nothing more
we can say about it.

**[01:24:59]** K: There is a great deal more
to say about it,

**[01:25:03]** but I won’t go into it.
Wait a minute, sir.

**[01:25:06]** I am talking of not becoming,
psychologically.

**[01:25:14]** Q: Yes.
K: That’s all, not anything else.

**[01:25:20]** Because that is part of our
great struggle, conflict

**[01:25:26]** – I must be, I must not be,
I have been, I should be.

**[01:25:32]** I’m talking in that field only.

**[01:25:36]** Q: Yes, all right.

**[01:25:39]** K: Now, if there is
an end to becoming

**[01:25:46]** – is that possible, first?

**[01:25:51]** I am conditioned,
I must not be conditioned,

**[01:25:56]** tell me how to be, etc., etc.

**[01:26:05]** So, is there a becoming
psychologically at all?

**[01:26:10]** Or thought has said,
‘You must become that’.

**[01:26:17]** I don’t know
if I’m making myself clear.

**[01:26:22]** I’ve always a cause and an effect.

**[01:26:26]** I always have a goal, an end.

**[01:26:32]** But if I have no cause,
if I have no end,

**[01:26:37]** if I have no saying,
‘I have been, I should be’,

**[01:26:41]** if I wipe out all that

**[01:26:47]** – what?

**[01:26:51]** What remains?

**[01:27:03]** Q: Clearly, whatever remains can’t
either be a sense of individuality

**[01:27:07]** or a sense of time or a sense
of becoming or a sense of goal.

**[01:27:12]** K: I said I wiped out all that.
Q: Yes.

**[01:27:17]** So, we can say what it’s not,

**[01:27:21]** but I don’t see what we can say
about what it is, of what remains.

**[01:27:26]** K: I think we can, more or less.

**[01:27:29]** We can indulge in description,
but the description is not the real.

**[01:27:42]** Our minds are always occupied
with something – right? –

**[01:27:47]** something or other.

**[01:27:52]** What happens
if there is no occupation?

**[01:27:58]** Do I go to sleep?

**[01:28:01]** Does the mind go to sleep,

**[01:28:05]** therefore must be occupied
to keep itself alive?

**[01:28:11]** Or if the brain,
if one sees occupation,

**[01:28:17]** whether it is with Jesus or cooking,
is the same occupation.

**[01:28:25]** Q: Well, I don’t think
it’s the same occupation.

**[01:28:32]** K: So, I’m concerned whether
it is possible not to be occupied.

**[01:28:41]** Q: If one is not becoming and
one is not occupied, one still is.

**[01:28:48]** K: Now, what is that?

**[01:28:52]** Q: Being as distinct from becoming.

**[01:28:58]** K: Is that being static?

**[01:29:03]** Q: This is what thought
tends to put on this.

**[01:29:07]** K: That’s right – what is that state
when there is no becoming?

**[01:29:16]** When thought is in abeyance,
as it were,

**[01:29:21]** what is that state?

**[01:29:32]** Q: I feel that state is awareness.

**[01:29:43]** K: Awareness.
Just awareness?

**[01:29:49]** Q: That’s what I feel.

**[01:29:57]** Q: A sense of freedom.

**[01:30:06]** Q: Awareness of the whole.

**[01:30:13]** K: Let’s look at it for a minute.
I’m occupied

**[01:30:17]** with meditation, with writing,
with this, with that,

**[01:30:21]** and I say, ‘How silly.
I won’t be occupied’.

**[01:30:26]** There is no occupation.
What is happening?

**[01:30:45]** Is it empty?

**[01:30:51]** And what’s wrong with being empty?

**[01:31:08]** Q: It doesn’t seem possible
to empty oneself of thought.

**[01:31:13]** It doesn’t seem possible.
K: Why do you say it’s impossible?

**[01:31:18]** Q: Because one’s mind
is endlessly going on and on.

**[01:31:24]** K: Going on and on with what?
Q: With thought.

**[01:31:27]** K: Ah, well.

**[01:31:33]** That’s why we asked, madame,

**[01:31:35]** if thought could
see itself in action.

**[01:31:50]** Q: This emptiness you describe
is an attainable state, I think,

**[01:31:56]** but now we have to ask,
how long can we remain in that state

**[01:32:01]** and what is the value
of being in it?

**[01:32:02]** K: Ah, not ‘how long’

**[01:32:05]** – then we are back.
Q: But we are back.

**[01:32:08]** We don’t live in that state.

**[01:32:11]** The question is
how it modifies life and the world.

**[01:32:30]** K: Sir, for a few seconds I have
this feeling of complete emptiness

**[01:32:35]** and therefore
a feeling of wholeness.

**[01:32:39]** I don’t know if it’s right.

**[01:32:44]** I feel empty – not ‘I feel’ –
there’s emptiness

**[01:32:49]** and that has the appearance
or feeling

**[01:32:53]** or the actuality of something whole.

**[01:32:57]** It lasts a few seconds

**[01:33:01]** and then I’m back
– I’m then occupied.

**[01:33:05]** I’m occupied with that feeling now.

**[01:33:09]** ‘By Jove, I had that feeling,
that sense of enormity of wholeness

**[01:33:16]** and I’d like to capture it again’.

**[01:33:20]** So that becomes my occupation.

**[01:33:30]** I’m occupied with something
that is finished.

**[01:33:35]** Now, the memory is reviving that
and we’re occupied with that.

**[01:33:42]** Q: You might then
write a very good poem.

**[01:33:46]** Wordsworthian description of poetry

**[01:33:49]** – emotion recollected
in tranquillity.

**[01:33:58]** Which surely is
a worthwhile companion.

**[01:34:01]** K: Sir, that’s over.
As far as I’m concerned

**[01:34:05]** that incident of wholeness
is gone, finished.

**[01:34:11]** It’s a dead thing.

**[01:34:13]** But my concern is,
why is my mind occupied?

**[01:34:22]** Is it because if it’s not occupied,
it’s frightened?

**[01:34:28]** Because in occupation, there is
a certain sense of security.

**[01:34:35]** Suddenly take it away,
I’m lost.

**[01:34:39]** So, it’s frightened.

**[01:34:40]** Q: It could also be a habit.
K: It can be a habit, of course.

**[01:34:46]** Or it feels, ‘If I’m not occupied,
I am terribly lost, I am lonely’

**[01:34:53]** – you follow? –
all those things operate.

**[01:35:00]** Q: Aren’t most people occupied

**[01:35:02]** because they don’t want to see
what they are?

**[01:35:05]** K: Yes, sir.

**[01:35:13]** Q: But we’ve also said
when we’re not occupied

**[01:35:16]** – it lasts a second or so –

**[01:35:18]** there’s a marvellous
feeling of wholeness.

**[01:35:21]** So, when we’re thinking
of not wanting to be occupied,

**[01:35:24]** it’s just conjecture, surely?
K: Not when… No.

**[01:35:34]** To observe ourselves and
be aware that we’re occupied.

**[01:35:41]** Q: But you pointed out the incident
just now of not being occupied

**[01:35:46]** and there being
a marvellous feeling of wholeness.

**[01:35:49]** When you’re again occupied,
you want to continue this.

**[01:35:54]** On the other hand you’re saying
we’re afraid not to be occupied.

**[01:36:00]** And yet we want this
marvellous feeling of wholeness.

**[01:36:13]** Q: Krishnaji, you also said whether
this feeling of wholeness is static.

**[01:36:20]** When the mind is not occupied
in becoming or in any other sense,

**[01:36:26]** whether that feeling is static.

**[01:36:34]** K: Find out, sir.

**[01:36:37]** Q: My immediate response is that,
even for a split second,

**[01:36:41]** I get this feeling of wholeness.

**[01:36:44]** K: Just a minute.

**[01:36:46]** Because we have talked about it
or it is actuality?

**[01:36:50]** Q: It is an actuality.
K: No, be clear, be careful.

**[01:36:55]** Because Mrs Porter
talked about being whole

**[01:37:02]** and the marvellous feeling of it,

**[01:37:06]** that very verbalisation
has helped me

**[01:37:09]** to capture something
through the words.

**[01:37:13]** Be careful.

**[01:37:17]** It is not an actuality.

**[01:37:23]** Q: You reach a stage whereby you
cannot believe yourself either way.

**[01:37:31]** You can be in a position whereby
you can doubt yourself, endlessly.

**[01:37:38]** K: Sir, look, we started asking,
why are we so occupied?

**[01:37:49]** Because when you are so occupied,
there is no space.

**[01:37:55]** Right? No freedom.

**[01:37:59]** When the mind is turning over,
chattering away by itself,

**[01:38:03]** there’s no freedom.

**[01:38:08]** And one asks, why doesn’t one
stop being occupied? That’s all.

**[01:38:19]** Q: Something must follow that, sir.

**[01:38:22]** These moments
of freedom from the known,

**[01:38:25]** these epiphanies,
these moments of perception,

**[01:38:29]** must then lead on to something.

**[01:38:31]** K: It does.
Q: They form a new conditioning.

**[01:38:35]** We’ve been talking about
states of being all this time,

**[01:38:38]** but being must lead to doing.

**[01:38:44]** Perhaps there is the root of change.

**[01:38:47]** K: Even that word, sir…

**[01:39:00]** If the universe has
no cause for existence,

**[01:39:06]** why should we have a cause?

**[01:39:09]** I don’t know, this leads…

**[01:39:24]** Q: Does this habit of occupation
damage your brain cells?

**[01:39:31]** The habit of occupation,
will it damage the brain cells?

**[01:39:36]** So it becomes a habit of your brain.

**[01:39:50]** K: Isn’t it time to stop?

**[01:39:55]** Our tummies may be occupied.
