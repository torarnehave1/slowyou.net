Unlocking the Secrets of Brown Noise: A Journey to Deep Relaxation and Restful Sleep and protection for high stressors.

Brown noise is a type of noise that has a lower frequency and a rougher sound compared to white noise. It is believed to have a calming effect on the body and brain, and some people use it to help them sleep or relax. The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the brain that produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Delta and theta waves are types of brain waves that are associated with deep sleep and relaxation. It is suggested that listening to brown noise can help to increase the production of delta and theta waves, which can lead to a deeper, more restful sleep.

Coma the sound.

Are you tired of tossing and turning at night, unable to find the peace and rest you need to function during the day? Let me introduce you to “Coma,” a song that was crafted with the intention of helping you achieve just that. The soothing sounds of brown noise, paired with the natural rhythms of delta and theta waves, will transport you to a place of deep relaxation and tranquility. Imagine your pineal gland, the little guardian of your sleep, producing melatonin in abundance, allowing you to drift off into a peaceful slumber. Close your eyes and let the gentle sounds of “Coma” wash over you, carrying you away to a place where you can finally get the rest you deserve.

To get the most out of “Coma,” I recommend setting aside just 15 minutes a day to listen to it, ideally while lying down. Make sure to use earphones for the best experience, as they will help to block out any external distractions and allow you to fully immerse yourself in the soothing sounds. As you listen, let yourself relax and let go of any tension or stress you may be holding on to. The combination of brown noise, delta and theta waves, and melatonin production will work together to help you achieve a deeper, more restful sleep, leaving you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning. Give “Coma” a try and experience the benefits of a restful night’s sleep for yourself.

Coma a sound recording 

Coma” is not just any ordinary sound recording, it was captured on board a boat in Istanbul on the Bosphorus during a full moon. The recording captures not only the soothing sounds of brown noise from the boat’s engine, but also the natural Soundscapes of the water, the current of the sea, and the atmosphere of the boat. The full moon on the Bosphorus also adds to the emotional and mystical atmosphere. By listening to “Coma” you’ll be able to tap into the powerful energy of the full moon and the unique soundscape of the Bosphorus.

My journey as a sound healer and sound researcher.

As a sound healing practitioner and researcher, I have been working with gongs, sound, soundscapes and sound healing for over 11 years. I have devoted myself to understanding the power of sound and how it can be used to improve the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of individuals. Throughout my years of research and practice, I have found that the use of gongs and other instruments in sound healing can be incredibly effective in helping to release stress and tension, reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, and improving overall emotional well-being.

My work is not only limited to sound healing sessions but also includes creating soundscapes to be used in different environments, such as relaxation and meditation centers, spas, and yoga studios. My goal is to provide people with the opportunity to experience the benefits of sound healing and to be exposed to the power of soundscapes.

I believe that sound is one of the most powerful tools we have for healing and self-discovery, and I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others. If you’re interested in supporting me and my work, you can do so by sharing this information or making a donation. Your support will help me to continue my research and to reach more people with the benefits of sound healing.

Beyer Dynamic DT 770 headphones

At AlivenessLab, we recommend the use of Beyer Dynamic DT 770 headphones for the best listening experience with our recordings. These headphones are professional-grade, studio-quality headphones that provide exceptional sound quality and comfort.

One of the main reasons we recommend these headphones is their high level of accuracy and detail in sound reproduction. The DT 770 headphones feature a closed-back design that provides excellent sound isolation, which allows the listener to fully immerse themselves in the soundscapes without any external distractions.

Additionally, the headphones have a frequency response of 5Hz-35kHz and a high sensitivity of 96dB that ensures a wide dynamic range and a precise reproduction of low and high frequencies. This ensures that the listener will experience the full range of frequencies in our recordings, including the subtle nuances that are crucial for the therapeutic effect of the sounds.

The headphones also have an over-ear design with a comfortable and breathable padding, which makes them suitable for prolonged listening sessions. The DT770 also come in different impedance levels, 32, 80, 250 ohms, that can be adjusted to the listener’s equipment and preferences.

In summary, the Beyer Dynamic DT 770 headphones are an excellent choice for those looking to fully experience the therapeutic effects of soundscapes and recordings. Their high level of accuracy and detail in sound reproduction, comfort and sound isolation make them a perfect fit for AlivenessLab’s research and soundscapes.
