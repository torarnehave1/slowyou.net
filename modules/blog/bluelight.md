Spiritual experiences often transcend the boundaries of specific religions or belief systems. These moments of profound connection can come unexpectedly, leaving a lasting impact on our lives. I’d like to share my own story of a spiritual encounter, not as a testament to a particular faith, but as a reminder that spirituality is a deeply personal and universal human experience.

#### My Encounter with the Divine Light

One night, as I was lying in bed just before sleep, I had an extraordinary experience that forever changed my perception of spirituality. A bright blue light appeared and entered my body directly into my heart. The sensation was overwhelming, filling me with a profound sense of peace and connection. At that moment, I felt the presence of Jesus Christ, an energy so pure and loving that it defied any previous understanding I had of spiritual encounters.

This experience wasn't about adhering to a specific religion or set of beliefs. It was a direct, personal connection with something far greater than myself. It reminded me of the words of Carl Jung, who once said, "The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are." In that moment, I felt closer to my true self than ever before.

#### The Universality of Spiritual Experiences

Similar experiences have been recounted throughout history and across cultures. For instance, in his book "Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion," Sam Harris describes a moment of profound peace he experienced on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee:

> “As I gazed at the surrounding hills, a feeling of peace came over me. It soon grew to a blissful stillness that silenced my thoughts. In an instant, the sense of being a separate self—an ‘I’ or a ‘me’—vanished. Everything was as it had been—the cloudless sky, the brown hills sloping to an inland sea, the pilgrims clutching their bottles of water—but I no longer felt separate from the scene, peering out at the world from behind my eyes. Only the world remained.”

Harris’s experience, though occurring in a Christian historical context, was interpreted through his secular lens. This highlights that spiritual experiences are not confined to the boundaries of organized religion. They can happen to anyone, anywhere, and often leave a profound impact regardless of the person's religious background.

#### Embracing Spirituality Beyond Religion

In our quest for spiritual understanding, it's important to recognize that these experiences are not necessarily about following a particular doctrine or dogma. They are about the direct, personal connection we feel with the divine or the universe. As Rumi, the 13th-century Persian poet, beautifully put it, "The lamps are different, but the light is the same."

We all seek moments of transcendence, where we feel connected to something greater than ourselves. Whether through meditation, prayer, or moments of unexpected clarity, these experiences remind us of our shared humanity and the universal nature of spirituality.

#### Conclusion

My experience with the blue light was a profound reminder that spirituality is not confined to the walls of any single religion. It is a deeply personal journey that each of us can embark on, regardless of our beliefs. Sharing our stories and embracing the diversity of spiritual experiences can help us connect more deeply with ourselves and each other.

In the end, it’s not about what we believe, but about the connection we feel and the transformation we undergo. Let’s continue to explore these experiences with open hearts and minds, embracing the light that shines within us all.

#### The Role of AI in Supporting SlowYou™: Enhancing Creativity and Efficiency

As a member of the SlowYou™ community, I have personally experienced the incredible impact of AI in enhancing creativity and efficiency. With the help of AI technologies like ChatGPT, I have been able to improve my spelling, organize my content more effectively, and generate new ideas effortlessly. This has allowed me to focus more on the essence of my work and unleash my creative potential.

Being someone with ADHD, I have faced unique challenges in my journey towards personal growth and well-being. However, AI has been a game-changer for me. By automating time-consuming tasks, AI has freed up my energy, enabling me to prioritize self-care, engage in physical activities, and connect with nature.

It's important to note that AI is not here to replace our thoughts or creativity. Instead, it acts as a supportive tool that complements and enhances our abilities. By embracing the collaboration between humans and AI, I have discovered new levels of productivity, inspiration, and personal growth.

We strongly believe in taking a holistic approach to AI usage. We encourage everyone to take breaks, listen to their bodies, and nurture their overall well-being. By integrating AI technologies mindfully, we can harness their potential while maintaining a balanced and mindful lifestyle.

Let's continue to explore the endless possibilities that AI offers, while staying grounded in our connection to ourselves, others, and the natural world.
