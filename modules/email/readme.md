The error message you're encountering indicates that Gmail is rejecting the login attempt because it requires an application-specific password. This typically happens when you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled for your Google account. When 2FA is enabled, you can't use your regular password to log in from less secure apps or devices. Instead, you need to generate an application-specific password.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### Steps to Generate an Application-Specific Password for Gmail

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)**:
   - Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
   - Click on "Security" in the left-hand menu.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," make sure 2-Step Verification is set up. If not, set it up by following the prompts.

2. **Generate an Application-Specific Password**:
   - After enabling 2FA, go back to the "Security" section of your Google Account.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," you’ll see an option for "App passwords."
   - Click on "App passwords."
   - You may need to re-enter your Google account password.
   - Under "Select app," choose "Mail."
   - Under "Select device," choose the device you are using (or choose "Other (Custom name)" and name it accordingly).
   - Click "Generate."
   - Google will provide you with a 16-character app password.

3. **Use the Application-Specific Password in Nodemailer**:
   - Update your Nodemailer configuration to use the generated application-specific password instead of your regular Google account password.

### Example Configuration with Application-Specific Password

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'Gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-application-specific-password', // Use the generated app password here
  },
});

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'This is a test email sent using Nodemailer.',
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
  console.log('Preview URL: %s', nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info));
});
```

### Additional Notes

- **Security Considerations**: Make sure to keep your application-specific password secure and do not share it. It's also a good idea to store it in a secure environment variable rather than hardcoding it into your application.
- **Less Secure Apps**: If you prefer not to use 2FA and app passwords, you can enable access for less secure apps in your Google account settings. However, this is not recommended as it reduces the security of your account.

By following these steps, you should be able to authenticate and send emails using Nodemailer with your Gmail account.
