Utilizing Less for tailoring Bootstrap offers numerous advantages:

1. **Variables**: Less enables the definition of variables for colors, font sizes, spacing, and other design elements. This centralized control facilitates swift modifications, ensuring changes cascade seamlessly across stylesheets.
  
2. **Nested Selectors**: Less supports nested selectors, enhancing the logical organization of styles and minimizing redundancy. This fosters readability and ease of maintenance in stylesheets.

3. **Mixins**: Less empowers the creation of reusable style blocks known as mixins. These aid in curtailing repetition and fostering modularity within stylesheets.

4. **Mathematical Operations**: Less facilitates mathematical operations within stylesheets, enabling dynamic calculations. This feature proves invaluable for crafting responsive designs and deriving sizes based on contextual values.

5. **Importing**: Less allows for the seamless importation of other Less files, facilitating the division of stylesheets into more manageable segments. This organizational approach enhances project navigation and collaboration.

6. **Extending**: Less permits the extension of existing selectors, mitigating duplication and promoting the creation of modular stylesheets.

7. **Customization**: Combining Less with Bootstrap streamlines the customization process, enabling effortless alignment with brand aesthetics or design guidelines. By tweaking default variables, alterations in colors, fonts, spacing, and other design elements become straightforward.

8. **Performance**: As a preprocessor, Less compiles code into CSS prior to browser delivery, optimizing website performance. This optimization reduces the volume of CSS to be downloaded and parsed, thereby enhancing website speed.

Overall, leveraging Less for Bootstrap customization fosters the development of more modular, maintainable, and personalized stylesheets. Additionally, it enhances website performance and facilitates collaborative development efforts.
