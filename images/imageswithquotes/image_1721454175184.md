**Stay in Therapy as Long as It's Worth It**

"You will stay in therapy as long as you feel it is worth the time, effort and money you invest." - Alexander Lowen, Bioenergetics: The Revolutionary Therapy That Uses the Language of the Body to Heal the Problems of the Mind (1977)

Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and growth. It's essential to recognize that the value of therapy lies in the investment you make in yourself. At @alivenesslab and @slowyou, we believe that every moment of therapy is a step towards greater aliveness and wellness.

Join us on this journey of self-awareness and healing. Let's move towards a life that is more fulfilling and meaningful.
